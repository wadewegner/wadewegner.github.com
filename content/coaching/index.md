# My Coaching Philosophy

As a UESCA-certified ultrarunning coach, my philosophy centers on one fundamental truth: every runner is unique. I don't believe in one-size-fits-all training programs. Instead, I offer a personalized approach that combines exercise science with real-world practicality.

At the core of my coaching is the belief in an athlete-centered partnership. Your goals are my priority, and our success is built on open, two-way communication. While I serve as your guide, educator, and motivator, you maintain ownership of your journey. This relationship creates a powerful foundation for achieving your ultrarunning aspirations.

My approach is firmly grounded in exercise science and human physiology. Training plans are structured with purpose, following a progressive adaptation approach. We begin with high-intensity, lower volume work early in your training cycle, then transition to lower intensity, higher volume as race day approaches. I believe in individualized periodization and smart volume progression that goes beyond the traditional "10% rule," adapting to your personal recovery and adaptation rates.

What sets my coaching apart is its real-world practicality. Life doesn't always follow a perfect training plan, so I create flexible programs that adapt to your schedule while maintaining their effectiveness. We'll incorporate race simulation training, develop practical pacing strategies, plan real-world nutrition approaches, and build mental toughness through targeted exercises and experiences.

My commitment is to help you achieve your ultrarunning goals safely and effectively. Through our partnership, you'll receive a training experience that's personalized to your needs, grounded in science, and focused on long-term success. Whether you're preparing for your first ultra or aiming for a personal best, I'm here to guide you every step of the way.
