# My Coaching Philosophy

As a [UESCA-certified ultrarunning coach](https://uesca.com/coach-directory/entry/9794/), my philosophy centers on one fundamental truth: every runner is unique. I don't believe in one-size-fits-all training programs. Instead, I offer a personalized approach that combines exercise science with real-world practicality.

At the core of my coaching is the belief in an athlete-centered partnership. Your goals are my priority, and our success is built on open, two-way communication. While I serve as your guide, educator, and motivator, you maintain ownership of your journey. This relationship creates a powerful foundation for achieving your ultrarunning aspirations.

My approach is firmly grounded in exercise science and human physiology. Training plans are structured with purpose, following a progressive adaptation approach. We begin with high-intensity, lower volume work early in your training cycle, then transition to lower intensity, higher volume as race day approaches. I believe in individualized periodization and smart volume progression that goes beyond the traditional "10% rule," adapting to your personal recovery and adaptation rates.

What sets my coaching apart is its real-world practicality. Life doesn't always follow a perfect training plan, so I create flexible programs that adapt to your schedule while maintaining their effectiveness. We'll incorporate race simulation training, develop practical pacing strategies, plan real-world nutrition approaches, and build mental toughness through targeted exercises and experiences.

My commitment is to help you achieve your ultrarunning goals safely and effectively. Through our partnership, you'll receive a training experience that's personalized to your needs, grounded in science, and focused on long-term success. Whether you're preparing for your first ultra or aiming for a personal best, I'm here to guide you every step of the way.

Want to learn more about how we can work together? Let's discuss your ultrarunning goals and create a plan that works for you.

# Limited Availability & High Expectations

As an active professional balancing multiple commitments, I intentionally maintain a small, focused coaching roster. This allows me to provide the dedicated attention each athlete deserves. I'm selective in who I work with, looking for athletes who match my level of commitment to the sport and process.

My ideal athletes are:

- Serious about their ultrarunning goals and willing to put in the work
- Comfortable with open, honest communication
- Ready to engage in a collaborative coaching relationship
- Committed to using TrainingPeaks as our primary training platform
- Understanding that success in ultrarunning requires patience and consistency

I believe in quality over quantity when it comes to coaching relationships. If you're looking for a coach who will be deeply invested in your journey, are ready to embrace the training process, and want to join a small community of dedicated ultrarunners, we might be a good fit.
