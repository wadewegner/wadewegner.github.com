Today I presented on the Windows Azure Platform at the [Day of Cloud](http://www.dayofcloud.com/) conference, in Chicago, IL. This conference was hosted by [Tech in the Middle](http://www.dayofcloud.com/about.html), and gave speakers the opportunity to present on SalesForce.com, the Windows Azure Platform (yours truly), Amazon Web Services, and Google App Engine. A great concept, and a lot of fun.

Gabe and Scott from [Tech in the Middle](http://www.dayofcloud.com/about.html) recorded and posted each of these talks. You can find them here:
