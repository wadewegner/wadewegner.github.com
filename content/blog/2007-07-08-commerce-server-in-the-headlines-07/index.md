I’ve been meaning to start posting an aggregation of notable Commerce Server blog and forum postings. I’ve never found that Google or Technorati do a great job of searching or summarizing blog topic discussions, so I’ll try to do my best to relate what’s going on in the Commerce Server community. Mostly, these posts come from people listed in my Commerce Server blogroll, as well as the Commerce Server forums.

Please let me know if I’ve missed any notable Commerce Server posts or announcements!
