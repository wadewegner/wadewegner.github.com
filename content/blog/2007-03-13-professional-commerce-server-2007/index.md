I have just closed a deal with Wrox (<http://www.wrox.com/>) to write a book on Commerce Server 2007!

This book will be part of the Professional series, and entitled *Professional Commerce Server 2007*. Writing begins next week, and should be completed by the end of Q3, 2007. It should hit store shelves some time in late 2007, early 2008. A long process, yet hopefully very worthwhile!

This book will deal with advanced topics, such as:

- Best practices and development environments
- Commerce Server core systems architecture
- Building a Commerce Server site / using the Starter Site
- Using the Business Management Systems
- The Pipeline Framework
- Web Services and SOA
- SQL Reporting Services
- Core systems deep dive
  - Catalog System
  - Inventory System
  - Marketing Campaigns
  - Customer and Orders Manager System
- BizTalk 2006 adapters
- The Commerce Server 2007 MOM Pack
- Production architecture
- Deployment tools and methodology
- Commerce Server staging
- Deploying and securing the site
- Tuning and optimizing

Additionally, the last quarter of the book will be advanced “how-to” topics, with lots of examples. These are based on the most common questions and scenarios requested by companies using Commerce Server, and will take the reader from start to finish.

I will try to periodically post information to this blog. Stay tuned!
