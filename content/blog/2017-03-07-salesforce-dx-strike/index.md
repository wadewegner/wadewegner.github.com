Like many people at Salesforce and in the community, I was really excited and impressed to see [Lightning Strike by Appiphony](http://www.lightningstrike.io/). Not to take away from the remarkable tool they built to visually explore and configure Lightning components, I was most excited by the custom Lightning Components they built and released to the community through their [Github repository Strike-Components](https://github.com/appiphony/Strike-Components).

Immediately I wanted to try these components out myself. And fortunate, using Salesforce DX, it’s really quite easy.

Here’s a Gist showing the commands I ran to quickly pull these open source Lightning components into my Salesforce DX workspace and push into my scratch org.

I think this is a great example of how Salesforce developers can quickly take advantage of open source software.

In fact, this has me thinking that there’s more we can do as part of Salesforce DX to make this even easier. Stay tuned for more updates!
