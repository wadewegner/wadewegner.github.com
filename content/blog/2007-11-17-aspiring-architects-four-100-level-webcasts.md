I only recently noticed a four-part series of MSFT webcasts focused on aspiring architects, hosted by Mohammad Akif and Dave Remmer. I found these links after visiting the blog of [Hanu Kommalapati](http://blogs.msdn.com/hanuk/default.aspx), an MSFT architect evangelist. He links to the [aspiring architects webcasts](http://blogs.msdn.com/hanuk/archive/2007/04/25/webcasts-for-aspiring-architects.aspx) himself, as well as [Mohammad's blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/mohammadakif/).




Here are links to the webcasts, as well as some high-level notes on the various topics discussed.




Note: you may think that these webcasts would focus on architecture from the MSFT perspective, but really the presenters do a great job of staying mostly agnostic to technology and platform.
