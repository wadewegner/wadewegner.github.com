It's been a while since I've sat down and written a blog post. I'm humbled to say it took me a few hours to relearn Hugo and get it functioning on my PC. But this post isn't about Hugo, migrating from GitHub Pages to Netlify, nor my decision to archive 12 years of old blog posts.

This blog post is to say, well, I have things I want to say.

For the last several years, my passion has been ultrarunning, and I want a place to share my journey. At best, I'm a midpack runner, but I've run in many beautiful places and picked up a thing or two that might be worth sharing. And, secretly, I hope to be more competitive one day. (Shh, don't tell anyone.)

My blog historically was technical, focused on products related to my work, and educational. I wrote dozens of "how to" and "introducing" posts related to everything from BizTalk Server, to C#, to Heroku. I archived all those posts because, frankly, they exceeded their shelf-life. I'm less interested in sharing the latest feature or release; instead, I want to share my thoughts about things that have more permanence.

Of course, I reserve the right to write a thing or two about what I'm up to professionally. So, there might be a few technical posts. But only a few. Or not. We'll see.
