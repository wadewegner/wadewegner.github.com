I awoke to see a very encouraging post from [Ryan Donovan on the future of Commerce Server](http://blogs.msdn.com/rdonovan/archive/2007/05/23/update-on-commerce-server-futures.aspx).

Some key points to take away:

  * Microsoft is committed to their e-commerce platform, and has no plans to roll Commerce Server into another server product (for those of you who follow, there has been a lot of speculation and rumors about Microsoft not being fully committed to Commerce Server - this really helps to dispel those rumors).

  * Microsoft plans to provide "successors for the current Commerce Server SKUs"

  * The standard support life cycle for Commerce Server 2007 ends 07/12/2011.

  * Microsoft plans to find more and better ways to align Commerce Server to major product revisions in the Windows Server, SQL Server, .NET Framework, and BizTalk Server spaces.

  * The team also plans to add incremental updates and features "on an interim a la carte basis".

So, as I said, very encouraging.

Some things I'd like to see in future releases ...

  * A fully managed stack; get rid of COM dependencies

  * Replace pipelines with Windows Workflow

  * Replace DTS tasks with SSIS

  * There's more, but it's early and my brain is not working yet ...

Given the major enhancements Commerce Server 2007 has made over previous versions, I'd say we can expect to see a lot of great things from the Commerce Server team.

Best of luck!
