Last Monday, three of us from Statera (Troy Hall, Colin McGraw, and myself) presented on the topic of Silverlight at the first MSDN Masters Series presentations in Denver, CO. This event was hosted by Joe Shirey, an architect evangelist for MSFT, and was geared towards technical folks at the 200-300 level.

 

We presented the following three sessions over the course of four hours:

 

>   
> 
> 1. Programming Silverlight (Wade Wegner)       
2: ASP.NET, AJAX and Silverlight (Colin McGraw)        
3: Silverlight and Media (Troy Hall)

 

We had a good healthy attendance, and it is my hope that the topic was received well by the audience.

 

As promised, here are the slides from the presentation:
