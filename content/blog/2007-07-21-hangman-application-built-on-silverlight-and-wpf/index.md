Unfortunately I don’t have enough time at the moment to write-up a full post that outlines how this works (we have friends coming over for dinner), but I wanted to at least share my very first attempt at a Silverlight and WPF web application.

Check out [**Hangman**](http://apps.wadewegner.com/hangman/)!

It’s a pretty slick (albeit graphically retarded) Silverlight application. It uses [Microsoft Silverlight 1.1 Alpha](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/eula.aspx?id=e2c1a44f-0b5c-face-28c8-08a26f2e0b3c) (for Windows), and I built it on the work I did [devising a strategy to (consistently) win hangman](http://www.wadewegner.com/2007/07/16/DevisingAStrategyToConsistentlyWinHangmanPartI.aspx).

![Hangman with Silverlight and .NET 3.5](https://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/HangmanapplicationbuiltonSilverlightan.5_EC67/image_1.png)

I plan to eventually write a post explaining exactly how I setup my development environment, how the technology within this application functions, and I’ll post the source code (once I refactor it).

What do you think? Have you built any Silverlight applications?
