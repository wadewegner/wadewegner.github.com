This application looks pretty awesome. In addition to giving me the ability to post to my blog directly from my Windows Phone, it looks like I can also: create & edit pages, moderate comments, and review my blog statistics (not that it’s impressive).

I’ve been very happy with the applications hitting the Windows Phone Marketplace – just last week I discovered an application to help me [manage my Windows Home Server from the phone](http://www.whsphone.com/). What’s next?

Definitely try it out the WordPress application; get more information at: <http://windowsphone.wordpress.org/>
