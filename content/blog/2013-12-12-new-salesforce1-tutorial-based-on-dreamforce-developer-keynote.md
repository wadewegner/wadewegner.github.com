title: Salesforce1 Tutorial for the Dreamforce '13 Developer Keynote
---

We just released a [Salesforce1 tutorial on Github](https://github.com/developerforce/demo-df13-devkeynote-s1app) that walks you though the same demo presented by [Dave Carroll](http://twitter.com/dcarroll) at the [Dreamforce '13 Developer's Keynote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELBWQIVcfk&feature=share&list=PLScnZWsj0lrRCMuciE0La1_iKtCPt4Kka).

This tutorial enables you to do the following with Salesforce1:

* Use the [Force Command-Line Interface (CLI)](http://github.com/heroku/force) tool to manipulate metadata in Salesforce.
* Create a **Salesforce1 mobile application** using the Salesforce1 app container.
* Create **Visualforce components and pages** enabled for the Salesforce1 mobile application.
* Use **mobile cards** and create **publisher actions**.
* Create a **compact view** for the page layout that is better designed for the Salesforce1 mobile application.
