title: A Command-line Interface for Force.com
---

Released this week at Dreamforce is a new command-line interface (CLI) tool for Force.com. This tool is open-sourced and available at [http://github.com/heroku/force](http://github.com/heroku/force). This tool lets you quickly interact with the Force.com APIs and opens up interesting opportunities for scripting and automating tasks on Force.com.

![Apex code example](http://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/2013-11-18-ApexCode.png)

You can immediately download the precompiled binaries for the force command-line interface and start using it today:

* Linux: [32-bit](https://godist.herokuapp.com/projects/heroku/force/releases/current/linux-386/force) | [64-bit](https://godist.herokuapp.com/projects/heroku/force/releases/current/linux-amd64/force)
* OS X: [32-bit](https://godist.herokuapp.com/projects/heroku/force/releases/current/darwin-386/force) | [64-bit](https://godist.herokuapp.com/projects/heroku/force/releases/current/darwin-amd64/force)
* Windows: [32-bit](https://godist.herokuapp.com/projects/heroku/force/releases/current/windows-386/force.exe) | [64-bit](https://godist.herokuapp.com/projects/heroku/force/releases/current/windows-amd64/force.exe)

Simply download the binary and run it from the command-line.

	Usage: force <command> [<args>]
	
	Available commands:
	   login     Log in to force.com
	   logout    Log out from force.com
	   whoami    Show information about the active account
	   sobject   Manage sobjects
	   field     Manage sobject fields
	   record    Create, modify, or view records
	   export    Export metadata to a local directory
	   import    Import metadata from a local directory
	   query     Execute a SOQL query
	   apex      Execute anonymous Apex code
	   version   Display current version
	   update    Update to the latest version
	   help      Show this help
	
	Run 'force help [command]' for details.

Let's take a look at a few simple examples.

To start, you need to login so that you are able to execute commands against Force.com.

	> force login

When you initiate the login experience the tool will open up your browser so that you can enter your username and password.

![Login](http://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/2013-11-17-Login.png)

Using some internal trickery (you can take a look [here](https://github.com/heroku/force/blob/master/force.go#L374) to get in on the secret) the browser is able to return the OAuth token to the command-line. Now the command-line is able to make authenticated calls to force.com.

Once logged in, you're ready to go.

	> force whoami | grep Username
	Username: wwegner@64demo.com

Just in case you forget.

Let's create a new object.

	> force sobject create MyNewObject Description:string

This creates a new object called **MyNewObject** with a string field called **Description**.

You can confirm it is created.

	> force sobject list | grep MyNewObject
	MyNewObject__c

Okay. So, in addition to these simple commands, you can also run apex code. You will likely not use this by hand all of the time, but this provides a great opportunity for scripting.

Let's give it a try.

	> force apex
	MyNewObject__c newObject = new MyNewObject__c();
	newObject.Description__c = 'description';
	insert newObject;

Now, hit Control-D to submit the code for execution.

	>> Executing code...

Pretty fantastic. The possibilities are almost endless.

Now, if you really want to have some fun, you can fork the [fork the heroku/github repository](https://github.com/heroku/force/fork) and start to extend the command-line interface itself! Let me show you how to quickly get started.

The force command-line interface is built using the [Go programming language](http://golang.org/). Go is a fun C-derived language originally created at Google. There's a good book called [An Introduction to Programming in Go](http://www.golang-book.com/) that provides a good overview of the language.

In order to build the source make sure you have the following setup.

* The [Go language runtime](http://golang.org/pkg/runtime/). Download and install this tool. Make sure you can execute it from the command-line (i.e. it's in your path).

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads/). The force command-line Go package has dependencies on packages that are hosted on Github and Bitbucket.

Go uses packages for builds so that it's easier to manage dependencies.

The first step is to create and set your GOPATH - this is where go will place packages you get later on. I have mine set simply:

	> echo $GOPATH
	/Users/wwegner/go

Ideally you should add this to your ~/.bash_profile but you can also quickly set it by typing:

	export GOPATH="/Users/wwegner/go"

Once you have set the GOPATH you can grab the Go package for the force command-line interface.

	> go get -u github.com/heroku/force

When this finishes you'll find you have three folders in your go folder.

![Go folder](http://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/2013-11-18-GoFolder.png)

If you explore these folders you'll find that they include all the dependences you need in order to successfully build and install the force command-line tool locally.

Fantastic.

Now, clone your forked heroku/force repository so that you have the bits pulled down locally. Browse to the folder and type the following:

	> go build

Since you have your GOPATH setup correctly you will find that this will create a **force** binary in your local directory. You can easily run it.

	> ./force login

And you're all set! Now, you can start to update the *.go files, build a new binary, and away you go.

Hopefully you've found this a useful introduction to the force command-line interface. I'm sure we'll find more ways to benefit from this tool over time!
