As I am new to Illinois, I recently started looking around to find out about some of the local user groups. My friend and colleague, [Dave Bost](http://www.davebost.com/blog/) (developer evangelist and co-host of [The Thirsty Developer](http://thirstydeveloper.com/)), recently sent me the following list of user groups in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. I’m not yet sure if this is an exhaustive list or if I’m missing some key groups. Please let me know if I’m missing any.
