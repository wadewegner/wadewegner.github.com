One of the most common questions people ask is, how can we integrate Commerce Server 2007 with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007? Well, Henry Winkler, a consultant with Microsoft Consulting Services in Denver whom I've had the pleasure to work with in the recent past, has written the following white paper:

This whitepaper includes code samples that make it easy to integrate these two products together.

Thank you Henry!
