… and I can’t wait!

For the last two months I’ve been working on a project that uses the [“Windows Cloud OS” and “Cloud Services”](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9115978), and I can’t wait until we disclose all the details at [PDC 2008](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/). Expect to see a significant amount of details regarding this cloud computing project as we get closer and closer to PDC.

In the meantime, enjoy a sneak peak at the work done by one of our ad agencies – can you feel the excitement??

If you have any interest in the new Windows 7 and Microsoft’s cloud computing strategy, you won’t want to miss [Microsoft PDC 2008](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/)!
