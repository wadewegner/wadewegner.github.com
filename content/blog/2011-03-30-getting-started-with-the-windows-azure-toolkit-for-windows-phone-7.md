I have just published a short screencast that demonstrates how to get started with the [Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone 7](http://watoolkitwp7.codeplex.com/). This toolkit is designed to make it easy to build phone applications that use cloud services running in Windows Azure.

 

 

In this screencast you will learn:

 

  
  * Where to download the toolkit
   
  * How to install and setup the toolkit
   
  * How to use the new project templates
 

To get started, head to the CodePlex project at [http://watoolkitwp7.codeplex.com/](http://watoolkitwp7.codeplex.com/). For additional information, can also take a look at my previous blog post [announcing the toolkit](http://www.wadewegner.com/2011/03/windows-azure-toolkit-for-windows-phone-7/) or an excellent explaination of the toolkit from [Mariano Converti](http://blogs.southworks.net/mconverti/2011/03/25/windows-azure-toolkit-for-windows-phone-7-released/). You can also watch [Cloud Cover Episode 41](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Cloud+Cover/Cloud-Cover-Episode-41-Windows-Azure-Toolkit-for-Windows-Phone-7) to learn more about the toolkit.
