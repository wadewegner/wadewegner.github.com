I know that [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) is nothing new and that many of you are already using it, but until recently I had managed to resist. However, upon joining Microsoft and getting to know my evangelist peers, I found Twitter to be a great way to both keep in touch and coordinate with my friends and coworkers. Furthermore, having recently moved from Colorado to Illinois, I found that Twitter is also a great way to keep in touch with distant and remote friends. It's great to hear what's going on with my friends, like [Rich Finn](http://blog.richfinn.net/) and [Ryan McCutchen](http://www.ryan.mccutchenoutpost.com/); also, unlike instant messaging technologies, we don't have to be online at the same time. 

So, as you have probably guessed, I have started to Twitter; you can follow me at: [http://twitter.com/wadewegner/](http://twitter.com/wadewegner/).

There are tons of people twittering away all day long, and one of the challenges I've had is filtering out the the noise. Consequently, the one bit of advice I will give to newcomers is to start slow and resist the temptation to start following hundreds of people all at once; I did this at first, and I found it overwhelming.

As a RESTful service using simple SMS, Twitter makes it easy to interact via many different clients. One that I've started using on my Windows Mobile 6 device is [TinyTwitter](http://www.tinytwitter.com/). This tool allows me to read the messages of people I'm following and post updates when I'm away from my computer.

Neat stuff. Try it out, and feel free to follow!
