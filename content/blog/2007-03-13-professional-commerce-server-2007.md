I have just closed a deal with Wrox ([http://www.wrox.com/](http://www.wrox.com/)) to write a book on Commerce Server 2007!

This book will be part of the Professional series, and entitled _Professional Commerce Server 2007_. Writing begins next week, and should be completed by the end of Q3, 2007. It should hit store shelves some time in late 2007, early 2008. A long process, yet hopefully very worthwhile!

This book will deal with advanced topics, such as:

  * Best practices and development environments 
  * Commerce Server core systems architecture 
  * Building a Commerce Server site / using the Starter Site 
  * Using the Business Management Systems 
  * The Pipeline Framework 
  * Web Services and SOA 
  * SQL Reporting Services 
  * Core systems deep dive 
    * Catalog System 
    * Inventory System 
    * Marketing Campaigns 
    * Customer and Orders Manager System
  * BizTalk 2006 adapters 
  * The Commerce Server 2007 MOM Pack 
  * Production architecture 
  * Deployment tools and methodology 
  * Commerce Server staging 
  * Deploying and securing the site 
  * Tuning and optimizing

Additionally, the last quarter of the book will be advanced "how-to" topics, with lots of examples. These are based on the most common questions and scenarios requested by companies using Commerce Server, and will take the reader from start to finish.

I will try to periodically post information to this blog. Stay tuned!
