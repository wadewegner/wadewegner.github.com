The Commerce Server team has released four white papers outlining how to use the Commerce Server adapters to export a product catalog, export an inventory catalog, export new orders, and export user profiles. If you are attempting to use the adapters (or even thinking about it), I highly encourage you to take a look at these white papers. If nothing else, they will give you a good overview of how you can make use of these adapter (I've been wanting to blog on them for awhile now, but haven't found the time).
