It's often nice, while working with BizTalk (or any other MS product, for that matter) to have UDL files available to allow you to quickly setup your connections to various databases. A UDL file is essentially a file that saves connection information, making it available for future use.

To create a UDL file, follow these steps:

1. Open a folder (or use the desktop) and create a new text file (right-click --> New --> Text Document).

2. Rename the extension from ".txt" to ".udl". Ignore the warning message.

3. Double-click the new UDL file.

4. Configure your database connection settings.

5. Once you've been able to successfully test your connection, click the OK button.

That's it! It's that simple! Now your UDL file is available for future use.

Best of luck!
