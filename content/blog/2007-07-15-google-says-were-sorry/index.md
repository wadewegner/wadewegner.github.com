I was performing an advanced search on [Google Blog Search](http://blogsearch.google.com/?tab=wb&hl=en) (posts that include “commerce server 2007” over the past week) when allow of a sudden I started getting the following error:

![We’re sorry … but your query looks similar to automated requests from a computer virus or spyware application](https://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/GooglesaysWeresorry_112F5/image_1.png)

Que?! What is it with me and search engines?!

Something very similar happened awhile back when I was [searching Yahoo](http://www.wadewegner.com/2007/06/14/DoYouYahooNoCantSayThatIDo.aspx). I got the infamous “error 999”, which evidently is most often caused by bandwidth limiting that Yahoo! invokes to prevent [DoS (Denial of Service) attacks](http://www.wadewegner.com/ct.ashx?id=a2874f4e-8f7f-4309-b2fb-94cf4e2051a4&url=http%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fDenial-of-service_attack) and automated processes that overload their systems.

Come on now, is it too much to be able to perform some advanced searches? While I wasn’t surprised to see this happen with Yahoo!, I’ve come to expect more from Google.

Sheesh!
