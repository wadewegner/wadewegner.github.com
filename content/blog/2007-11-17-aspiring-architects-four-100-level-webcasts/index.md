I only recently noticed a four-part series of MSFT webcasts focused on aspiring architects, hosted by Mohammad Akif and Dave Remmer. I found these links after visiting the blog of [Hanu Kommalapati](http://blogs.msdn.com/hanuk/default.aspx), an MSFT architect evangelist. He links to the [aspiring architects webcasts](http://blogs.msdn.com/hanuk/archive/2007/04/25/webcasts-for-aspiring-architects.aspx) himself, as well as [Mohammad’s blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/mohammadakif/).

Here are links to the webcasts, as well as some high-level notes on the various topics discussed.

Note: you may think that these webcasts would focus on architecture from the MSFT perspective, but really the presenters do a great job of staying mostly agnostic to technology and platform.

[Part 1 - Aspiring Architects - Architecture 101](http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/eventdetail.aspx?EventID=1032338971&culture=en-CA)

- What is architecture?
- Why worry about architecture?
- Types of architecture?
- Types of architects?

- Governance challenges and solutions strategies
- How to be an effective architect

[Part 3 - Aspiring Architects - Services orientation and other architectural paradigms](http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/eventdetail.aspx?EventID=1032338978&culture=en-CA)

Will you feel empowered to confidently act as an architect after watching these webcasts? Maybe not. Will you get a good, high-level overview of what it means to be an architect, along with tips on making the transition from a developer/IT professional to an architect role? You bet!

I hope this helps!
