It only took me two or three months, but I finally updated my [Silverlight Hangman application](http://apps.wadewegner.com/hangman/default.aspx). It was originally written an earlier version of Silverlight 1.1 alpha, and I hadn’t taken the time to update it.

The only things I had to do was switch out the Silverlight.js file and change the value of “Hidden” to “Collapsed” for the “Visibility” property of objects. Otherwise I was able to use the same files in the Beta 2 version of Visual Studio 2008.

(Darn, I bet when Visual Studio 2008 is released soon I’ll have to update it again! Oh well!)

Enjoy!
