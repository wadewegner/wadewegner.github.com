Today we released the [Windows Azure Platform Training Kit – August 2011](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=130354). The Windows Azure Platform Training Kit (WAPTK) includes a comprehensive set of technical content including hands-on labs, presentations, and demos that are designed to help you learn how to use the Windows Azure platform.

In addition to the offline training kit above, we have pushed updates to the [Windows Azure Platform Training Course](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/gg271268) on MSDN.

***What’s new in this release?***

Today announced the [August 2011 release of the Windows Azure Tools for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2011/08/02/announcing-the-august-2011-release-of-the-windows-azure-tools-for-microsoft-visual-studio-2010.aspx) (i.e. VS Tools for Windows Azure 1.4). New to these tools are the following capabilities:

- Profile applications running in Windows Azure
