description: I've spent a fair amount of time recently building Go apps. Every time
  I've set it up on Windows I've had to re-learn the steps. This post is a short tutorial
  for setting up Go on Windows.
title: Easy Go Programming Setup for Windows
---

I've had to do this more than once recently, so I figured I'd document the simple steps for setting up the Go programming language on Windows. Most of this is simple and straightforward. The only tricky part I found is setting up your GOPATH, which defines a convention for storing and building Go code you write and acquire from open source code repositories.

### 5 Simple Steps ###

Follow these five simple steps to install Go.

1. Make sure you have both Git [download](http://git-scm.com/download/win) and Mercurial [download](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Download) installed. With Go programming you'll make heavy use of open source repositories.

2. **Download** and **install** the latest 64-bit Go MSI distributable (which sets most of the environmental variables for you). [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)

	To make things simple, use the default installation path at `C:\Go`

3. Ensure the **Go binaries** (found in `C:\Go\bin`) are in your `Path` system environment variables. To check click `System`, `Advanced system settings`, `Environment Variables...` and open `Path` under `System variables`:

	An easy way to confirm is to open the command line and type `go version`:

4. Setup your **Go workspace**. This consists of three folders at the root:

	    bin/
		pkg/
		src/

	I create a `C:\Projects\Go` folder as my root Go workspace:

5. Create the **GOPATH environment variable** and reference your Go workspace path. To add, click `System`, `Advanced system settings`, `Environment Variables...` and click `New...` under `System variables`:

	![gopathenvvar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/746259/5536717/6ef223da-8a53-11e4-96bf-3cbbd9acf589.png)

	Set the variable name to `GOPATH` and value to your Go workspace path (e.g. `C:\Projects\Go`):

	![gopathvalue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/746259/5536757/feb28c94-8a53-11e4-9bf4-02728abe34e5.png)

	You can quickly check to ensure your path has been set by opening the command line and typing `echo %GOPATH%` and check the output:

And that's all it takes! You're ready to get started.

### Verify ###

Want to quickly test and ensure this is all working as expected? Open the command line and type the following:

{{< highlight bat >}}

go get github.com/golang/example/hello
%GOPATH%/bin/hello

{{< / highlight >}}

You should see the output as "Hello, Go examples!" (refreshingly, not your typical hello world):

![gohelloworld](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/746259/5536857/ad39c088-8a55-11e4-9080-c87d62ca55c8.png)

I hope this helps!
