While scavenging the web for information related to both self-service and inventory catalogs, I came across the following post by Martin: [Commerce Server 2007 - Backorderable Products](http://blogs.conchango.com/martinrennie/archive/2007/03/08/Commerce-Server-2007-_2D00_-Backorderable-Products.aspx). I think it’s a good post showing how to configure your inventory catalog to allow for backorderable items.

I hope to see more posts from Martin in the future!
