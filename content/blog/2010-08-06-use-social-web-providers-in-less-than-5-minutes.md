Significant [Access Control Service](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/appfabric/) (ACS) updates released to AppFabric LABS environment today. Take a look at the [Windows Azure AppFabric team blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazureappfabric/) for the formal announcement. I’d rather show you a quick demo.

                                   ![Get Microsoft Silverlight](http://go2.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=108181)              
                               [                 ![Get Microsoft Silverlight]()             ](http://go2.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=124807)                            

               

 

Quick summary of new capabilities in the Access Control Service:

 

  
  * Integration with Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) and tooling 
   
  * Out-of-the-box support for popular web identity providers including: Windows Live ID, OpenID, Google, Yahoo, and Facebook 
   
  * Out-of-the-box support for Active Directory Federation Server v2.0 
   
  * Support for OAuth WRAP, WS-Trust, and WS-Federation protocols 
   
  * Support for the SAML 1.1, SAML 2.0, and Simple Web Token (SWT) token formats 
   
  * Integrated and customizable Home Realm Discovery that allows end-users to choose their identity provider 
   
  * An OData-based Management Service that provides programmatic access to ACS configuration 
   
  * A Web Portal that allows administrative access to ACS configuration 
 

Try this out yourself. Use Visual Studio, install [Windows Identity Foundation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/dd440951.aspx), and go to [https://portal.appfabriclabs.com/](https://portal.appfabriclabs.com/).
