While reading [Scott Bellware’s](http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/default.aspx) blog today, I came across his [Simpson’s alter ego](http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/archive/2007/08/31/167371.aspx), courtesy of [Simpsonize Me](http://simpsonizeme.com/). I had to try it out!

Evidently, here’s what I look like as a Simpson’s character … the likeness is uncanny:

Here’s me taking a trip to the Quik-E-Mart:

Personally, I think my wife makes a better looking Simpson character than I do:

My daughters also make cute Simpson’s characters:

Neat stuff! Give it a try.
