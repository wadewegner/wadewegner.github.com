One of the best career decisions I’ve made was to join the **Windows Azure Platform Evangelism team** last July. Yes, it was a lot of work to uproot the family and move to Seattle, but it was absolutely worth it. I pinch myself nearly everyday to make sure that it’s not just a dream – the opportunities here are tremendous:

 
  * Work with an incredible group of smart, driven, **technical leaders**
   
  * Interact with **product teams**, help to shape the direction of **product innovation**, and work with customers on building awesome applications 
   
  * Build great **sample applications**, **demos**, **HOLs**, and **training kits**
   
  * Present at marquee conferences, such as **PDC**, **TechEd**, and **MIX** – many of these around the world 
   
  * Create **keynote demos** that get highlighted in major conferences 
   
  * Stay on the **bleeding edge** of technology, reading through specs and working with bits _months_ ahead of their release 
 

My teammate, [Vittorio Bertocci](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vbertocci/), has also blogged about this – definitely [read his post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vbertocci/archive/2011/01/06/my-team-is-hiring.aspx), as he’s been a Technical Evangelist much longer than I have, and he **still** is excited to get out of bed in the morning!
