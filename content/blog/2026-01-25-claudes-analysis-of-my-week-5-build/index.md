## Workout Breakdown

### 1. 8 Miles Easy + 5×30s Hill Strides
**Monday, January 13 (Jan 20 file timestamp)**

| Metric | Actual | Planned |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Duration | 1:47:18 | 1:21:45 |
| Distance | 10.42 mi | 8.19 mi |
| TSS | 111 | 81 |
| Elevation | 593 ft | — |

**Heart Rate:**
- Avg: 134 bpm | Max: 157 bpm
- Aerobic TE: 3.6 | Anaerobic TE: 0.9

**Cadence:** Avg 168 spm | Max 200 spm

**Lap Analysis (Stride Intervals):**
The workout shows a clear structure with ~5 miles easy warmup, followed by 5 hill stride repeats:

| Interval | Distance | Time | Avg HR | Max HR |
|----------|----------|------|--------|--------|
| Stride 1 | 0.05 mi | 0:41 | 152 | 156 |
| Stride 2 | 0.05 mi | 0:48 | 149 | 154 |
| Stride 3 | 0.06 mi | 0:51 | 150 | 156 |
| Stride 4 | 0.06 mi | 0:54 | 148 | 154 |
| Stride 5 | 0.06 mi | 1:03 | 154 | 157 |

**Analysis:** You exceeded planned distance by 2+ miles while keeping the easy pace honest. The stride efforts show consistent execution—HR climbing into the low 150s for each rep, which is appropriate for short hill surges. The progressive lengthening of stride 5 (1:03 vs ~0:45 average) suggests you pushed that final effort a bit harder. Excellent aerobic foundation work with just enough neuromuscular stimulus to keep the legs sharp.

### 2. Uphill Treadmill Threshold (15×3 min)
**Tuesday, January 14 (Jan 21-22 file timestamp)**

| Metric | Actual | Planned |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Duration | 1:27:27 | 1:47:30 |
| Distance | 9.21 mi | 11.6 mi |
| TSS | 108 | 131 |
| Elevation | 442 ft | — |

**Heart Rate:**
- Avg: 136 bpm | Max: 164 bpm
- Aerobic TE: 3.7 | Anaerobic TE: 1.5

**Cadence:** Avg 170 spm | Max 236 spm (likely a spike)

**Interval Structure:**
The lap data shows alternating 3-minute and 2-minute blocks with recovery periods:

| Rep | Work Duration | Avg HR | Max HR | Notes |
|-----|---------------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | 3:00 | 142 | 149 | Building |
| 2 | 2:00 | 154 | 158 | — |
| 3 | 1:00 | 160 | 164 | Short burst |
| 4 | 3:00 | 147 | 159 | — |
| 5 | 2:00 | 159 | 160 | — |
| 6+ | — | 145-163 | — | Consistent execution |

**Analysis:** This was a structured threshold session with 15 work intervals. You came in under the planned duration and distance, which could mean either: (a) you held a higher intensity than prescribed and cut it appropriately, or (b) conditions or fatigue dictated a shorter session. HR averaging 136 overall but peaking at 164 during efforts suggests solid threshold work. The anaerobic TE of 1.5 (higher than other sessions) confirms you were touching the red line on those 3-minute blocks. Good discipline stopping when appropriate—this session carries real fatigue cost.

### 3. Easy Run
**Thursday, January 15 (Jan 23 file timestamp)**

| Metric | Actual | Planned |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Duration | 1:07:31 | 1:04:22 |
| Distance | 6.83 mi | 6.00 mi |
| TSS | 79 | 54 |
| Elevation | 531 ft | — |

**Heart Rate:**
- Avg: 130 bpm | Max: 155 bpm
- Aerobic TE: 3.3 | Anaerobic TE: 0.0

**Cadence:** Avg 168 spm | Max 178 spm

**Analysis:** Classic easy day executed well—single continuous lap, no intervals, just steady aerobic work. You added ~0.8 miles to the prescribed distance. The 531 ft of elevation gain on a "easy run" day is notable—you're training on terrain, not flat surfaces. HR stayed appropriately controlled with zero anaerobic training effect, exactly what you want for recovery adaptation between harder sessions. The gap between your avg HR (130) and max HR (155) suggests some terrain-induced spikes but nothing sustained.

### 4. Easy Run (Strides Skipped)
**Friday, January 16 (Jan 23-24 file timestamp)**

| Metric | Actual | Planned |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Duration | 0:46:26 | 1:20:55 |
| Distance | 4.32 mi | 7.83 mi |
| TSS | ~50 | 76 |
| Elevation | 150 ft | — |

**Heart Rate:**
- Avg: 120 bpm | Max: 133 bpm
- Aerobic TE: 2.4 | Anaerobic TE: 0.0

**Cadence:** Avg 166 spm | Max 174 spm

**Analysis:** Smart call. You were feeling tired heading into Saturday's race, so you cut the session short and dropped the strides entirely. The data confirms this was the right decision—ultra-low max HR of 133 bpm, only 2.4 aerobic TE, zero anaerobic stress. You got blood flow without digging into reserves. This is exactly the kind of pre-race adjustment that separates experienced ultrarunners from those who blindly follow the plan. The training plan's Saturday option ("training races any week... can replace long runs") was clearly in your sights, so preserving legs made sense.

### 5. Half Marathon Race
**Saturday, January 17 (Jan 24 file timestamp)**

| Metric | Actual | Planned Option |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Duration | 1:39:17 | 16-20 mi easy/mod |
| Distance | 13.26 mi (half marathon) | — |
| TSS | 203 | 140 |
| Elevation | 177 ft | — |

**Heart Rate:**
- Avg: 158 bpm | Max: 168 bpm
- Aerobic TE: 5.0 | Anaerobic TE: 0.0

**Cadence:** Avg 182 spm | Max 190 spm

**Race Execution:**
- **Finish Time:** 1:39:17
- **Average Pace:** 7:29/mi
- **HR Distribution:** Sustained 158 avg with tight ceiling at 168

**Analysis:** This changes everything—you weren't overrunning a long run, you were *racing*. And you executed beautifully. The training plan explicitly encourages using trail halfs as long run substitutes ("training races any week... can replace long runs"), so this was 100% on-script.

Race observations:
- **Pacing discipline:** Max HR only 10 bpm above average suggests controlled, even effort—no early blow-up
- **Elevated cadence (182 spm):** Characteristic of race-day turnover vs training shuffle
- **5.0 aerobic TE:** Maximum training stimulus, appropriate for a race effort
- **1:39:17 finish:** Solid half marathon on what appears to be a relatively flat course (177 ft gain)

The TSS of 203 is high but expected for race-intensity over 13+ miles. Friday's conservative approach paid dividends here—you showed up with fresh legs and executed.

**Race Result Context:** A 1:39 half at 158 avg HR suggests your aerobic engine is well-developed. For ultra purposes, this demonstrates you can sustain ~7:30 pace at threshold-ish effort, which bodes well for marathon+ pacing strategies.

### 6. Easy w/ 6×30 Hills
**Sunday, January 18 (Jan 25 file timestamp)**

| Metric | Actual | Planned |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Duration | 1:30:31 | 1:34:08 |
| Distance | 8.55 mi | 9.30 mi |
| TSS | 110 | 91 |
| Elevation | 567 ft | — |

**Heart Rate:**
- Avg: 123 bpm | Max: 139 bpm
- Aerobic TE: 3.0 | Anaerobic TE: 0.0

**Cadence:** Avg 168 spm | Max 182 spm

**Analysis:** Good recovery run the day after a monster long run. Similar to Friday's session, the FIT file shows one continuous lap without structured intervals, but the low HR profile (avg 123, max only 139) confirms you kept this appropriately easy. Coming up 0.75 miles short of plan is fine—listening to the body after Saturday's effort is smart. The 567 ft elevation gain indicates you're still getting hill work even on "easy" days, which is excellent ultramarathon specificity.

## Key Insights

### What's Working Well
1. **Race-week management** — Cutting Friday short to preserve legs for Saturday's half marathon was textbook execution
2. **Racing as training** — Using a half marathon per your coach's guidance ("training races any week") provides race-specific stimulus without the mental load of a pure workout
3. **Polarization** — Clear separation between easy days (HR 120-130) and race/hard days (HR 158+)
4. **Volume tolerance** — 53+ miles with 2,460 ft of climbing, including a half marathon race
5. **Terrain specificity** — Nearly every training run includes meaningful elevation

### Race Performance Notes
Your 1:39:17 half at 158 avg HR shows:
- Strong aerobic development (sustainable pace at moderate HR)
- Good pacing discipline (only 10 bpm spread between avg and max)
- Race-ready fitness for your ultra goals

### Areas to Monitor
1. **TSB of -29** — You're significantly fatigued, especially post-race. Recovery matters now
2. **Sunday's session** — Running 8.5 miles the day after racing is ambitious; the low HR (123 avg) suggests you kept it appropriately easy
3. **Next week's track workout** — Per your plan, Week 5 introduces 800/400/200 intervals. Make sure legs are recovered before attacking speed work

### Recommendations
- **Next 3-5 days:** Prioritize recovery—the race took more out of you than a normal long run would
- **Sleep:** With race fatigue + training load, 7.5+ hours is critical
- **Heat acclimation:** Your plan mentions "Heat ideal" for Tuesday—sounds like you're building heat tolerance deliberately

## Training Plan Context (Week 5)

Per your coach's plan, this week's structure was:

| Day | Prescription |
|-----|--------------|
| Mon | Rest / Heat ideal |
| Tue | 8-14 mi easy + 5×20s fast/2min easy (smooth & quick strides) |
| Wed | Track: 2-3 mi WU, 3-5×800/400/200 fast, 4×200 fast/slow, 2-3 mi CD |
| Thu | 1.5-2.5 hrs easy x-train / Mountain Legs |
| Fri | 6-14 mi very easy / Heat ideal |
| Sat | 16-20 mi easy/mod (1 hr mod to mod/hard "power hour") |
| Sun | 10-16 mi easy, pure recovery style / Mountain Legs |

**Key coach notes:**
- "Training races any week! If you have any trail half marathons or similar events near you, they can replace long runs"
- Saturday's "power hour" was designed to simulate race-specific effort
- Track workout helps "solidify speed gains"

You adapted the plan intelligently by racing Saturday and adjusting Friday accordingly.
