04/13/2008 - Please see [this post](http://www.wadewegner.com/2008/04/13/UpdateOnTheCommerceServerBook.aspx) for information regarding this book.

I’m excited to announce that Max Akbar, senior product manager for the Microsoft Commerce Server team, has agreed to work with me on the book *Professional Commerce Server 2007* (for WROX) as the official technical reviewer. This is great news, as Max has an incredible amount of knowledge and experience with the Commerce Server product, which will be invaluable as I write this book. I couldn’t be happier!
