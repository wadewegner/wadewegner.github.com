I was reading through the [FAQ document for the Windows Azure platform](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/faq/) this evening (what else is there to do on a Sunday night?), and I came across the following:

> **What is the Windows Azure AppFabric?**
>
> With AppFabric, Microsoft is delivering services that enable developers to build and manage composite applications more easily for both server and cloud environments. Windows Azure AppFabric, formerly called “.NET Services”, provides cloud-based services that help developers connect applications and services across Windows Azure, Windows Server and a number of other platforms. Today, it includes Service Bus and Access Control capabilities. Windows Server AppFabric includes caching capabilities and workflow and service management capabilities for applications that run on-premises.
>
> Windows Azure AppFabric is built on Windows Azure, and provides secure connectivity and access control for customers with the need to integrate cloud services with on-premises systems, to perform business-to-business integration or to connect to remote devices.
>
> The Service Bus enables secure connectivity between services and applications across firewall or network boundaries, using a variety of communication patterns. The Access Control Service provides federated, claims-based access control for REST web services. Developers can use these services to build distributed or composite applications and services.

I’ve spent a lot of time with the AppFabric, and believe I understand the intent of the above description. But what about the rest of you? If you have, or even if you haven’t, spent time using the AppFabric, how does this description resonate? Does this help you understand the AppFabric, or are you left confused? Do you understand it’s place and value in the larger Windows Azure platform?

I implore you to leave some feedback and let me know what you think. Please, share your thoughts! How can this be improved?
