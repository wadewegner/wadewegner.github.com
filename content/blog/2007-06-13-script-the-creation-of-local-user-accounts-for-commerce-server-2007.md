title: Script the creation of local user accounts for Commerce Server 2007

I'll be honest ... I'm lazy. I hate doing repetitive things over, and over, and over again. So, while I was going through and installing Commerce Server 2007 on a new virtual machine, I decided to script out the creation of the local user accounts. Before we get to the script, a little background ...

It is recommended that you create multiple accounts to handle the various roles within Commerce Server (such as the four web services, staging, etc). In a production environment, these should be created as Domain accounts; however, in development (or the virtual world) you may not have access to, or wish to use, a domain. Consequently, you can create these users as local accounts as well.

Below is a script that will go ahead and create these local users for you (if I have time I'll create a similar script for domain accounts). Copy the text (or download the link) and save it to a .vbs file. You should be able to simply double-click the file, and then open up Local Users and Groups under Computer Management to double-check.
