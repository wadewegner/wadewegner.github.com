I learned about the [FreeRice](http://www.freerice.com/index.php) program from [James McGovern’s blog post](http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2007/11/have-you-heard-of-free-rice-program.html). Not only does it appear to be a worthwhile program, but the it was fun to test my vocabulary.

I stopped after providing 500 grains of rice. I realized that my 500 grains wouldn’t make a difference unless I also spread the word. So please, dear reader, take a moment and [test your own vocabulary](http://www.freerice.com/index.php)!
