![100K Build: Week 6 of 16](images/ai-analysis.jpg)

I generated this analysis for [my week 6 training build for Gorge Waterfalls](https://www.wadewegner.com/2026/01/build-for-gorge-waterfalls-100k-week-6-of-16/) by taking my Garmin FIT files, my training plan, and then asking Claude for an analysis.

## Context
This was an "aerobic down week" per the training plan—meant to dial back stress while maintaining fitness heading into a bigger weekend. The week was complicated by travel to San Jose (Mon), a 3-day offsite (Tue-Thu), evening drives to SF, and accumulated sleep debt from early morning workouts.

---

## Workout Summary

| Day | Prescribed | Actual | Notes |
|-----|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Mon** | Rest / Heat ideal | — | Travel day to San Jose |
| **Tue** | 6-12 mi easy + 5×20s hills | **9.02 mi** @ 9:24/mi, 154' gain | ✓ Nailed it despite offsite |
| **Wed** | 10-13 mi easy/mod progressive, 2 mi cooldown | **7.25 mi** @ 10:04/mi, 118' gain | Shorter but smart given schedule |
| **Thu** | 1.5-2.5 hrs easy x-train + Mountain Legs | **8.34 mi** @ 9:33/mi, 95' gain | Ran instead of x-train; travel day |
| **Fri** | 4-12 mi very easy + 5×20s fast, Heat ideal | **Rest** | Good call—accumulated fatigue |
| **Sat** | 10-16 mi easy over hills, pure aerobic | **18.64 mi** @ 12:19/mi, 4,114' gain | 🔥 Crushed it—big mountain day |
| **Sun** | 8-14 mi easy over hills | **2.53 mi** @ 12:52/mi, 75' gain | Cut short—DOMS & fatigue |

## Daily Breakdown

### Tuesday, Jan 27 — San Jose AM Run
**9.02 miles | 1:24:52 | 9:24/mi | 154' ↑ | Avg HR 138 | Max HR 156**

- **Execution:** Strong effort considering the travel day. Heart rate distribution shows excellent aerobic control—90% in Z2 (130-150), only brief Z3 touches.
- **Prescription Match:** The plan called for 6-12 miles easy with hill strides. You hit mid-range on distance. The modest elevation suggests flat terrain (San Jose), so the "5×20s hills" likely weren't available.
- **Assessment:** ✓ Solid adaptation. Getting 9 miles in before a travel day shows commitment.

---

### Wednesday, Jan 28 — Offsite Day 1
**7.25 miles | 1:13:01 | 10:04/mi | 118' ↑ | Avg HR 126 | Max HR 137**

- **Execution:** Very controlled—82% Z1, 18% Z2. This was genuinely easy running.
- **Prescription Match:** Plan called for 10-13 miles with progression + cooldown. You were short by ~3-5 miles, but the relaxed effort was smart.
- **Assessment:** ✓ Good self-regulation. With offsite demands and early wake-ups, taking it easier was the right move. The low heart rate suggests you were consciously throttling back.

---

### Thursday, Jan 29 — Offsite Day 2 / Travel Home
**8.34 miles | 1:19:44 | 9:33/mi | 95' ↑ | Avg HR 138 | Max HR 150**

- **Execution:** Steady Z2 effort—94% in the 130-150 range. Clean aerobic work.
- **Prescription Match:** The plan suggested x-train (1.5-2.5 hours) with Mountain Legs strength. You ran instead—understandable given travel logistics.
- **Assessment:** ✓ Acceptable substitution. Running is running, and you kept it easy. The swap works for an ultra build.

---

### Friday, Jan 30 — Rest
**Prescribed: 4-12 mi very easy + 5×20s strides | Actual: Full rest**

- **Assessment:** ✓ Smart decision. After 3 days of sleep-deprived early workouts plus the drive back and accumulated offsite fatigue, your body needed recovery. The plan even noted "Heat ideal" which often doubles as a rest hint. Taking Friday off set you up for Saturday's big effort.

---

### Saturday, Jan 31 — Mountain Day 🏔️
**18.64 miles | 3:49:42 | 12:19/mi | 4,114' ↑ / 4,081' ↓ | Avg HR 138 | Max HR 160**

- **Execution:** This was the real work. Nearly 19 miles with 4,100+ feet of climbing—hitting close to 2,000 ft elevation at the peak. HR distribution was solid: 21% Z1 (recovery on descents/flats), 65% Z2 (sustained climbing), 14% Z3 (steeper pitches). Cadence dropped to 75 (expected on steep terrain).
- **Prescription Match:** Plan called for 10-16 miles easy over hills, "pure aerobic." You exceeded distance by ~3 miles and absolutely crushed the vert prescription. This is exactly what Cascade Crest prep demands.
- **Assessment:** 🔥 Outstanding. This is the session that moves the needle. Four thousand feet of climbing at controlled heart rates is race-specific work. The fact you "felt great" confirms the Friday rest was the right call.

---

### Sunday, Feb 1 — Recovery Attempt
**2.53 miles | 32:32 | 12:52/mi | 75' ↑ | Avg HR 110 | Max HR 120**

- **Execution:** Essentially a walk/shuffle—100% Z1, max HR only 120. Very short.
- **Prescription Match:** Plan called for 8-14 miles easy over hills with Mountain Legs strength work.
- **Assessment:** ✓ Correct decision to cut short. After Saturday's 4,100' vert bomb, significant DOMS was inevitable. Pushing through 8-14 more hilly miles would have been junk mileage at best, injury risk at worst. The low HR and abbreviated distance show you listened to your body.

## Analysis

### What Went Well

1. **Prioritization.** You correctly identified Saturday as the key session and protected it by taking Friday off. That trade-off was worth it—the mountain day delivered 4x the planned elevation gain.

2. **Heart rate discipline.** Every run except Sunday stayed primarily in Z2. No ego-driven tempo efforts during a down week. This is how you build aerobic base without digging holes.

3. **Travel-proofing.** Three consecutive early-morning runs in San Jose while managing offsite responsibilities is solid execution. Most people would zero out those days.

4. **Saturday's vert accumulation.** 4,114 feet is serious mountain work. This is exactly what you need for Cascade Crest's 22,500 feet of climbing over 100 miles.

### What Could Improve

1. **Wednesday's volume shortfall.** The plan called for 10-13 miles; you did 7.25. Not a big deal in isolation, but the week ended up ~10-15% below total prescribed volume (excluding Sunday's bailout, which was smart).

2. **Thursday substitution.** Cross-training exists for a reason—different muscle patterns, active recovery. Running three days straight (especially sleep-deprived) may have contributed to Sunday's fatigue.

3. **Strides omission.** Tuesday and Friday both prescribed short hill strides (5×20 seconds). These neuromuscular touches keep turnover sharp and don't add fatigue. Worth finding even on busy days.

### The Big Picture

This was a modified down week that turned into a mountain-focused mini-block. The weekday mileage was lower than prescribed (~24.6 vs potentially 30-40), but Saturday's effort compensated in the metric that matters most for Cascade Crest: vertical gain under aerobic control.

The Sunday bailout doesn't concern me—it shows maturity. Two-plus miles of Z1 shakeout is better than grinding through 10 junk miles on trashed legs.

## Physiological Notes

| Metric | Tue | Wed | Thu | Sat | Sun |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Avg HR | 138 | 126 | 138 | 138 | 110 |
| Max HR | 156 | 137 | 150 | 160 | 120 |
| Z2 Time % | 90% | 18% | 94% | 65% | 0% |
| Cadence | 86 | 85 | 85 | 75 | 77 |

- **HR Consistency:** Your steady-state aerobic HR appears locked at 138. This showed up Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday despite vastly different terrain and duration. Good sign of fitness stability.
- **Wednesday's lower HR (126):** Suggests intentional recovery pace or residual fatigue dampening output. Either way, appropriate for an overloaded week.
- **Saturday's cadence drop (75):** Expected on mountain terrain. Steep grades force slower turnover.

## Recommendations for Week 7

1. **Prioritize recovery early in the week.** Monday and Tuesday should be true easy or rest. Your legs need to clear the Saturday vert.

2. **Don't chase Sunday's missed miles.** The plan self-corrects. Trying to "make up" 10+ miles will just dig a deeper hole.

3. **Find the strides.** Even 4×20 seconds post-run keeps leg speed in the system. Flat or uphill, doesn't matter.

4. **Next big mountain day:** If Week 7 has another vert-focused long run, you're well-positioned—but respect the taper rhythm. Don't stack 4,000' weeks back-to-back without purpose.

## Summary

**Grade: B+**

Volume was below target (46 mi actual vs ~55-65 prescribed), but the quality was high where it mattered. Saturday's mountain effort alone justifies the week. The Friday rest and Sunday bailout were smart decisions, not failures. Sleep debt and travel are real stressors—you managed them without blowing up.

For Cascade Crest prep, this week delivered the goods: controlled aerobic work and serious vertical accumulation. Keep building.
