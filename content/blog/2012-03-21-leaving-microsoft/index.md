I’ve spent a fair amount of time thinking about the right title for this post. Steve Marx was clever with [Career vNext](http://blog.smarx.com/posts/career-vnext), Sriram Krishnan waxed poetic with [On Leaving Microsoft](http://sriramk.com/blog/2011/05/leaving-microsoft.html), and Brad Abrams just came out and talked about [My Last Day at Microsoft](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brada/archive/2010/04/20/my-last-day-at-microsoft.aspx). Yet no matter how it’s phrased it comes down to one thing: leaving Microsoft.

I can honestly say that I never thought this day would come. Working for Microsoft has been a dream come true – brilliant colleagues, interesting opportunities, and inspiring technologies. In particular, I’ve had a blast working on Windows Azure. I never envisaged that a [little project I worked on in 2008](http://www.wadewegner.com/2008/11/building-multi-enterprise-business-applications-on-the-azure-services-platform/) would lead me to Redmond and all the interesting things I’ve done over the last several years.

Fortunately for me (and I hope for you), I am not going far from Windows Azure. I’ll share more details soon but for now I’ll just say that I’m going “to put money where my mouth is” and help companies build real solutions on Windows Azure. This is going to be an amazing year for Windows Azure and I plan to push it to the limit!

Don’t hesitate to reach out to me – I’d love to stay in touch.
