![100K Build: Week 7 of 16](images/image.jpg)

Week 6 is in the books.

Looking back at [week 5](/2026/01/build-for-gorge-waterfalls-100k-week-5-of-16/) and [week 6](/2026/01/build-for-gorge-waterfalls-100k-week-6-of-16/), the progression has been intentional. Week 5 had a race effort baked in with the Snoqualmie River Half Marathon, and week 6 was designed as an aerobic down week to absorb that stress. I wrote up [Claude's analysis of week 6](/2026/02/claudes-analysis-of-my-week-6-build/) and it confirmed what I felt: travel, early mornings, and accumulated sleep debt made it a harder recovery week than it should have been. But I got through it, and the legs are coming around.

Now it's time to push again.

Week 7 marks the start of a bigger training block. Two weeks out from **[Fort Ebey Kettles Marathon](https://nwtrailruns.com/events/fort-ebey-kettles-trail-run/)** on February 14, this is the last real opportunity to stack meaningful work before tapering. I want to race hard at Fort Ebey, and that means this week needs to count.

One thing working in my favor: I'm not traveling. After last week's San Jose trip and the 3-day offsite, it's a relief to be home with a normal schedule. No red-eye wake-ups, no hotel treadmills, no juggling workouts around meetings. Just training. Stress is stress, and removing the travel stress means more capacity for training stress.

Sunday night and Monday are all about recovery. Sauna, good food, sleep. Let the body reset before the week's work begins.

Here's the plan, adapted from my coach's prescription:

| Day | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Training |
|-----|--|----------|
| Monday | | Rest day. Full recovery—sauna, food, sleep. |
| Tuesday | | **~10 miles easy with 5 x 20-second hill strides**. Waking the legs up without pushing hard. |
| Wednesday | | Main workout: **10K Intervals to Steady Finish**. 2-3 mile warm-up, then 2-3 sets of 4 x 600m fast (200m easy between reps, 600m easy between sets). Start at 10K effort and progress. Finish with 4 x 200m fast/200m slow, then 2 miles steady at 50K effort, and cool down. Around 11 miles total. |
| Thursday | | **Easy/moderate run, ~6 miles**. Solid aerobic stimulus without digging a hole. |
| Friday | | **Easy run, ~6 miles**. Keep the legs fresh heading into the weekend. |
| Saturday | | **Long run with threshold intervals, ~18 miles**. Easy/moderate base with 4-7 x 6 minutes at 1-hour effort, 2 minutes easy recovery. Big day on rolling terrain. Err on the side of easier effort on the intervals—true threshold, not race pace. |
| Sunday | | **~9 miles easy with 5 x 30-second steep hill strides**. Close out the week with some snap in the legs. |

The week targets around **60 miles** with two quality sessions: Wednesday's 10K intervals and Saturday's long threshold run. The rest is volume at easy effort, keeping the aerobic engine humming without accumulating unnecessary fatigue.

Wednesday's workout is about turnover and controlled speed. The 600m repeats at 10K effort keep the legs honest, and progressing through the sets builds the ability to run fast when tired. The steady 2-mile finish at 50K effort bridges the gap between speed and ultra-specific pacing.

Saturday is the anchor. Nearly three hours on feet with threshold intervals woven in. This is the kind of session that builds race-day confidence: long enough to matter, hard enough to hurt, but not so hard that it takes days to recover. The goal is to finish feeling like I could do more, not wrecked.

Fort Ebey is a trail marathon with real terrain, and I want to show up ready to race it, not just finish it. That means this week needs to be consistent and controlled. Hit the workouts, don't overdo the easy days, and trust the process.

The build continues. Let's roll.
