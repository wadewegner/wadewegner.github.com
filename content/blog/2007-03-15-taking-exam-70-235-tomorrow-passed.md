I have been studying for the MS exam [70-235: Developing Business Process and Integration Solutions Using Microsoft BizTalk Server](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-235.mspx) for the past couple months. Finding resources for this exam has been difficult, but I've found a few that were helpful. I was fortunate enough to take the following two Microsoft courses:

  * Course 2933: Developing Business Process and Integration Solutions Using Microsoft BizTalk Server 2006

  * Course 2934: Deploying and Managing Business Process and Integration Solutions Using Microsoft BizTalk Server 2006

Additionally, I purchased the book:

  * _Pro BizTalk 2006_, by George Dunphy and Ahmed Metwally (Apress, 2006). Of the few BizTalk 2006 books on the market, I found this to be the best.

Also, I made use of MSDN, various BizTalk blogs and forums, and all kinds of other online material.

In the end, I decided to compile a list of the various topics I thought would be useful. A colleague of mine (Mathew Shuster, an incredible BizTalk resource) suggested that I make sure to focus on both BAM (Business Activity Monitoring) and correlations.

So, here's the list of topics I put together:

  * Correlations

  * BAM (Business Activity Monitoring)

  * Business Rule Engine / Business Rule Composer

  * Group Hub page

  * HAT

  * Hub and Spoke model

  * EAI versus ESB

  * Persistence points

  * Atomic transactions

  * Role Links

  * BizTalk Tracking continuation

  * BizTalk Groups

  * Interchanges

  * Tracking Profile Editor

  * BizTalk Vocabularies

  * BizTalk Policies

  * Trading Partner Management

(Note: at some point, I'd like to write short articles on all the above topics.)

By no means do I mean to suggest that this list is exhaustive. Be sure to go to the above Microsoft link to see all the various topics that the exam covers.

As this exam focuses on BizTalk 2006, it's safe to assume that the exam file highlight features new to 2006, as well as try to trip you up with questions that have answers that may have been correct in 2004 but not in 2006. Be sure to watch out for these kind of questions.

Wish me luck!

**[Edit: 03/16/2007]**

I passed! While the exam was difficult (took me almost two hours), I definitely found it to be passable. My two weakest areas (according to my results) were in BAM and the Business Rule Engine. However, a pass is a pass!! :)

I think everything I previously wrote above still applies.
