It was a slower-than-normal week in the world of Commerce Server; that is, slow for everyone except [Max](http://blogs.msdn.com/maxakbar/default.aspx). The man is a Commerce Server animal!




The general slowness and lack of blog posts can probably be attributed to the [Worldwide Partner Conference](http://www.microsoft.com/partner/events/wwpartnerconference/) in Denver, CO., this past week. Lots of activity. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend. I've been swamped with BizTalk projects and [dirty diapers](http://www.wadewegner.com/2007/06/11/WegnerFamilyAddnewBabyGirl.aspx).




Here's what I read regarding Commerce Server this past week ...
