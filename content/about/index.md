I have been lucky to have so many amazing opportunities throughout my career, working with some of the smartest engineers and technologists in the world and filling various roles from software developer to technology evangelist to product executive.

I first started programming in middle school by writing Pascal-based scripts for VT220 telnet clients that automatically played (and leveled) characters in [MUDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD). Since then, I've worked on increasingly more complex solutions (if not as fun) including large-scale commerce implementations, low-latency distributed messaging systems, and building developer platforms.

Outside of work, I am an avid midpack ultrarunner and aspiring brewmaster. If you care to hear about my running and brewing adventures you can [follow me on hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/@WadeWegner).
