I have been lucky to have so many amazing opportunities throughout my career, working with some of the smartest engineers and technologists in the world and filling various roles from software developer to technology evangelist to technology executive.

I first started programming in middle school by writing Pascal-based scripts for VT220 telnet clients that automatically played (and leveled) characters in [MUDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD). Since then, I've worked on increasingly more complex solutions (if not as fun) including large-scale commerce implementations, low-latency distributed messaging systems, and building developer platforms.

But life's most meaningful challenges often find us outside the office. After discovering ultrarunning, I found a passion in exploring the limits of human endurance. What started as a personal journey has grown into something more meaningful, the opportunity to coach and guide other runners in their own ultradistance adventures. As a UESCA-certified ultrarunning coach, I've combined my love for systematic thinking with the raw challenge of long-distance trail running.

I believe in sharing these adventures and insights along the way. If you'd like to connect or follow along on these journey, you can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/wadewegner.com).
