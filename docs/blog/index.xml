      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve sat down and written a blog post. I&amp;rsquo;m humbled to say it took me a few hours to relearn Hugo and get it functioning on my PC. But this post isn&amp;rsquo;t about Hugo, migrating from GitHub Pages to Netlify, nor my decision to archive 12 years of old blog posts.
This blog post is to say, well, I have things I want to say.</description>

      <description>I never thought I’d be writing this blog post, yet here I am. After an incredible five years at Salesforce, it’s time to say “Mahalo a Aloha,” or thank you and goodbye.
I have so much gratitude for my colleagues at Salesforce, our customers, and of course, the fantastic Salesforce community. Never in my career have I felt the sense of mission that I have at Salesforce. The desire to advance the “state-of-the-art” for Salesforce developers was a passion reciprocated by my colleagues, supported by leadership, and always appreciated by our customers.</description>
