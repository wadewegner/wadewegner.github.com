      <description>I never thought I’d be writing this blog post, yet here I am. After an incredible five years at Salesforce, it’s time to say “Mahalo a Aloha,” or thank you and goodbye.
I have so much gratitude for my colleagues at Salesforce, our customers, and of course, the fantastic Salesforce community. Never in my career have I felt the sense of mission that I have at Salesforce. The desire to advance the “state-of-the-art” for Salesforce developers was a passion reciprocated by my colleagues, supported by leadership, and always appreciated by our customers.</description>

      <title>Build a Native Mobile App Using Salesforce DX and the Mobile SDK</title>

      <description>This week I had the opportunity to demo how developers can combine project-based app development with Salesforce DX, the Salesforce CLI, Scratch Orgs, and the Mobile SDK to make &amp;ndash; at least, in my humble opinion &amp;ndash; a pretty compelling native app dev experience with Salesforce. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll share some of the things I did with the hope that, after you look at it, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to try it out too.</description>

      <description>A different, if not more accurate or better, name for this blog post could be &amp;ldquo;Authenticate to a Scratch Org You Didn&amp;rsquo;t Create and Whose Password You Don&amp;rsquo;t Know.&amp;rdquo; I even went out to Twitter to ask for help and, well, Peter Churchill did not disappoint:
&amp;quot;I used JWT Bearer Flow with my Scratch Orgs and Dev Hub - you won&amp;#39;t believe what happened next!&amp;quot;

      <title>Using Salesforce DX with Trailhead</title>

      <description>As you&amp;rsquo;ve likely seen on Twitter, I&amp;rsquo;ve really gotten into Trailhead these past few months. In particular, the Superbadges. I not only enjoy the challenge of working through the project, but regularly discover I don&amp;rsquo;t know nearly as much as I think I do. There&amp;rsquo;s a ton of useful and practical information in Trailead just waiting for us all to discover.
Of course, I have other motivations for doing Trailhead. I find it&amp;rsquo;s an amazing way to validate various workflows with Salesforce DX.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a Salesforce developer, it&amp;rsquo;s likely you&amp;rsquo;ve heard us talk about Salesforce DX these past months. (If not, you&amp;rsquo;re missing out and you should checkout the official documentation.) Since TrailheaDX, everyone has been able to use the new tools and services we&amp;rsquo;ve made available as part of the Salesforce DX beta. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve thoroughly enjoyed building all kinds of plugins for the Salesforce CLI.
 My primary plugin with lots of functionality: https://github.</description>

      <title>Use Workbench with your Scratch Org</title>

      <description>The Salesforce Workbench is a powerful set of tools for developers and admins to use with their org. You can easily describe, query, manipulate, and migrate data and metadata through the web browser, using a combination of Partner, Bulk, REST, Streaming, Metadata, and Tooling APIs. It&amp;rsquo;s completely open-sourced on Github by Ryan Brainard (@RyanBrainard).
And if all of this isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to convince you of its value, I can almost guarantee that Josh Kaplan (@JoshSfdx) is playing around in Workbench right now!</description>

      <description>Using the capabilities of Salesforce DX you can enable some neat tricks. Such as displaying your org configuration in your Bash prompt:
But, first, a little background &amp;hellip;
The Salesforce DX CLI provides some powerful capabilities for tracking your Salesforce org. When you login with sfdx force:auth:web:login (-a &amp;lt;alias&amp;gt; lets you alias the org) your credentials are encrypted and stored locally. When running subsequent commands, you can append -u &amp;lt;username|alias&amp;gt; to the command to target an org.</description>

      <description>The Salesforce DX (SFDX) CLI makes it easy to run commands as a developer. It also makes it really easy to create scripts that facilitate automation. A great example is the following tweet from Pat Patterson:
#SalesforceDX is awesome! I can create a scratch org for testing from a bash script. Great job, @WadeWegner &amp;amp; team! pic.twitter.com/Nu3yI2UQH0

      <description>This post is valid for the Salesforce DX (SFDX) pilot. Please note that details may change and I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to update accordingly.
Recently I highlighted a neat way to use open source software with Salesforce DX. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve used Appiphony&amp;rsquo;s custom base components many, many times in demos and apps I&amp;rsquo;ve built.
It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for me to get tired of removing the Git details when pulling the OSS from Github.</description>

      <description>Like many people at Salesforce and in the community, I was really excited and impressed to see Lightning Strike by Appiphony. Not to take away from the remarkable tool they built to visually explore and configure Lightning components, I was most excited by the custom Lightning Components they built and released to the community through their Github repository Strike-Components.
Immediately I wanted to try these components out myself. And fortunate, using Salesforce DX, it&amp;rsquo;s really quite easy.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re so excited to have recently launched the Salesforce DX pilot. Our teams have been hard at work on Salesforce DX, and it&amp;rsquo;s tremendously exciting to have so many of you using the tools and trying out an entirely new way to build applications on the Salesforce platform.
I thought it would be helpful to share with everyone the demos from the Salesforce DX pilot kickoff webinar. This is cut directly from the webinar, so apologies for any rough edges.</description>

      <description>The New Year is a good time to set goals for yourself. I&amp;rsquo;ve challenged myself this year to explore and ship some apps using the Go language, which is likely no surprise given my recent posts on setting up Go on Windows and running Go on Azure Websites.
As part of my initial explorations, I used Azure Websites to host my Go web apps. The last post I wrote showed my first Go prototype on Azure Websites.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I wrote a GoLang web app and wanted to find a good place to host it. Given I work with the team that builds Azure Websites, it seemed only fitting to host it in Azure Websites. Turns out, it works great! However, there aren&amp;rsquo;t any resources available that walk you through the steps. Consequently, I wrote the following tutorial.
(Incidentally, if you want to start to use Go Language and run Windows you&amp;rsquo;ll want to review my post Easy Go Programming Setup for Windows.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had to do this more than once recently, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d document the simple steps for setting up the Go programming language on Windows. Most of this is simple and straightforward. The only tricky part I found is setting up your GOPATH, which defines a convention for storing and building Go code you write and acquire from open source code repositories.

      <description>Microsoft Project Siena (Beta) is a tool that allows a business user (i.e. non-developer) to quickly building rich business applications for Windows 8. You can learn all about the tool on the Microsoft Project Siena web site and by watching a set of tutorials on the Microsoft Project Siena (Beta) Channel 9 Blog.
Having recently left Salesforce to join Microsoft, I was curious about how to build a Project Siena app that integrated into Salesforce.</description>

      <description>iBeacon is the Apple trademark for a low-powered, low-cost transmitter that can notify nearby iOS 7 devices of its presence. It uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), also called Bluetooth Smart, technology to transmit an advertisement that includes a universally unique identifier (UUID). Android devices can receive iBeacon advertisements and, fortunately for those of us who like to hack around, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take too much work to setup a Raspberry Pi to emit iBeacon advertisements.</description>

      <description>I had the great pleasure this week to speak at TechEd North America 2014 on how we built the Salesforce Toolkits for .NET. It was a blast, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if I was the first Salesforce employee to speak at TechEd. Many thanks to my friends at Microsoft for the opportunity.
Here is the video recording of the talk on Channel 9:
 The highlight of the talk for me was that, rather than explain through slides, I built a brand new SDK during the talk and committed it live to Github in this repository.</description>

      <description>Earlier today a colleague asked me if I had an example of using Python to create an attachment in Salesforce. I didn&amp;rsquo;t, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from creating a couple. Sadly, our documentation here isn&amp;rsquo;t the greatest. You can look at the Insert or Update Blob Data for the REST API or Attachment for our SOAP API. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, neither document is good enough; I had to continue to dig around to figure out exactly what I needed.</description>

Shortly after Dreamforce last year I was turned on to Adafruit Industries by my teammate Reid Carlberg. I&amp;rsquo;ve since built a number of cool little gadgets, including the Brain Machine and the TV B Gone. Both projects were a ton of fun and a great way to get started with soldering and simple circuitry.</description>

But first, a special thanks to Rocky Assad and Delmer Johnson for the contributions they have made to the toolkits over the past couple weeks. It&amp;rsquo;s fantastic to see such passionate involvement from members of the Salesforce developer community!
There are three updates I&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss in this post:</description>

      <description>Two days ago I published a sample app for Windows Phone 8 that demonstrates how to authenticate users and make calls against the Force.com REST API using the Salesforce Toolkits for .NET. The next obvious step was to build a sample application for Windows 8. ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!
You can get the sample here: https://github.com/developerforce/Force.com-Toolkit-for-NET/tree/master/samples/Windows8OAuth.
To get authentication working in Windows 8 we&amp;rsquo;ll use the WebAuthenticationBroker, which manages the asynchronous authentication operation in a modal dialog window.</description>

      <description>One of the top requests I&amp;rsquo;ve received since releasing the Salesforce Toolkits for .NET has been a Windows Phone 8 sample application. I was very happy to oblige and today I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to share with you the Windows Phone 8 OAuth sample application. This sample makes use of the Developerforce.Force and Developerforce.Common NuGet packages. Since the .NET libraries in the toolkits are all portable class libraries developers are able to build applications targeting .</description>

      <description>If you follow me on Twitter, chances are you heard we released a set of Salesforce Toolkits for .NET last week. The reception has been extraordinary, and I&amp;rsquo;m so excited to see the applications developers build using these toolkits!

      <description>I am extremely pleased to announce the availability of two Salesforce Toolkits for .NET developers: the Force.com Toolkit for .NET and the Chatter Toolkit for .NET. These toolkits provide an easy way for .NET developers to interact with the Force.com and Chatter REST APIs using a native .NET libraries.
The easiest way to get started is to use the NuGet packages:
 Install-Package DeveloperForce.Force
Install-Package DeveloperForce.Chatter
You can find a set of API examples and samples in the Github repositories.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been building a set of libraries recently that make HTTP calls into the Force.com and Chatter REST APIs and I needed to find a way to test my methods and ensure that my HTTP Requests were constructed correctly. These libraries do a number of things to help make valid HTTP calls; any inadvertant changes (or introduced bugs) could cause a lot of problems. Fortunately, with help from Ryan Dunn, I was able to build some unit tests that are able to inspect my HttpRequestMessage an ensure that everything has been properly setup.</description>

      <description>We just released a Salesforce1 tutorial on Github that walks you though the same demo presented by Dave Carroll at the Dreamforce &amp;lsquo;13 Developer&amp;rsquo;s Keynote.
This tutorial enables you to do the following with Salesforce1:
 Use the Force Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool to manipulate metadata in Salesforce. Create a Salesforce1 mobile application using the Salesforce1 app container. Create Visualforce components and pages enabled for the Salesforce1 mobile application. Use mobile cards and create publisher actions.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I spent some time writing a Python token request script against the Force.com APIs. Today I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share a short code snippet for doing the same thing but this time using Lua.
Why Lua? Why not!
No, I have a good reason for getting this to work in Lua. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Webscript.io which provides a tremendously simple way to create web APIs. Webscripts are all written in Lua.</description>

      <description>Today I wrote some Python code for querying the Force.com REST APIs. It started pretty straightforward but I stumbled upon an important concept when I tried to run this Python from an untrusted location. More on this in a moment. Let&amp;rsquo;s start at the beginning.
You first need to create a Connected App.
A connected app is an application that integrates with salesforce.com using APIs and uses either SAML and OAuth protocols to authenticate, provide Single Sign-On, and provide tokens for use with Salesforce APIs.</description>

As you prepare to build a mobile app for the Salesforce $1 Million Hackathon next week, it may help to step back and reflect on the capabilities of the Salesforce Platform and how tapping into these capabilities will better enable you to compete. In particular, it will help to understand why, and how, access to rich customer data can give your application an edge – in both the hackathon and beyond.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year I started an incubation project at Aditi Technologies to explore Salesforce as a platform for building cloud applications. Today I start at Salesforce as a full-time employee.
Life is funny sometimes, no?
When I left Microsoft I did so to take a shot at building products and applications for Windows Azure. I&amp;rsquo;ve done that, and more. I hadn’t planned on leaving Aditi any time soon but there are some opportunities too awesome to ignore.</description>

      <description>Today I needed to configure Eclipse to use the Force.COM IDE. In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve edited Apex and Visualforce code either directly inline &amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip; or using the Developer Console. Both are decent for quick and dirty updates, but when it comes to applying best practices (i.e. automated builds, source control, and so forth) I don&amp;rsquo;t want to live in the browser.
There&amp;rsquo;s a good wiki article available on the Developer Force website which explains how to setup Eclipse with the Force.</description>

      <description>Special thanks to Michael Washam for helping me find and fix a bug in my code!
 I find myself regularly creating resources in Windows Azure, such as cloud services, virtual machines, storage accounts, virtual networks, and the like. Most of the time this is part of writing scripts or testing out deployments, and I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to keep them around indefinitely. The challenge this creates is how to cleanup all these resources.</description>

      <description>The Force.com REST API lets you integration with Force.com applications using standard HTTP methods. This API provides a way to expose the data you have within your Force.com application to external applications – both mobile and non-mobile. A few useful bits of information related to these REST APIs:
 Use standard HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, and HEAD. You can use either HTTP or HTTPS. Use standard security to authenticate your REST calls via OAuth 2.</description>

Quite fun, and I learned a lot from Adam Seligman, Dave Carroll, Pat Patterson, and Akhilesh Gupta. This is a great team: extremely personable, clearly excited about their platform and the technology, and willing to pull up their sleeves and write some code. My kind of people.
During the hack day I acquired a few tips for getting started.</description>

      <description>One of my goals this past year has been to get more hands-on with respects to real-world cloud applications. Working for Aditi has provided many opportunities to dig into some interesting cloud workloads. In addition to building all kinds of applications running in Windows Azure, I’ve learned a lot working with Ryan Dunn and Raghu Rajagopalan on building products (like Scheduler) that run in the cloud.
Coming from a Windows Azure focus at Microsoft my natural tendency has been to approach most problems with solutions in Windows Azure.</description>

I’m being purposely vague when saying “the cloud” – it could be Windows Azure, AWS, or even a traditional hosting provider. It’s likely you saw a great post by Michael Washam that provides a solution for using Windows Azure virtual machines along with Web Deploy and a few PowerShell scripts.</description>

Mary Jo Foley’s article Windows Azure storage issue: Expired HTTPS certificate possibly at fault provides the best coverage of the event as it unfolded.

      <description>So far I’ve really enjoyed developing applications for Windows 8. I still can’t claim to be particularly good at XAML design work yet, but I’m getting the hang of Windows Store Apps in C# using Windows RT. That said, there are have been a number of times when I’ve been lost and had to hit MSDN and search engines in order to figure things out. What makes this particularly challenging is that much of the information you’ll find is old and not appropriate for Windows 8 RTM.</description>

      <description>I’ve long advocated using JSON when building mobile and cloud applications. If nothing else, the payload size makes it extremely efficient when transferred over the wire – take a look at the size of the same information formatted as OData, REST-XML, and lastly JSON:
Pretty compelling.
Despite the use of JSON – and great frameworks like JSON.NET and SimpleJson – I always struggled with creating my C# classes when working with an existing web service that returned JSON.</description>

      <description>Excellent keynote today by Scott Guthrie and the Windows Azure team! I don’t know if it’s because I’m seeing it on the other side for the first time or if it’s due to the amazing new capabilities introduced into Windows Azure, but I loved every second of it! Within a few minutes Scott had jumped into a demo and it was nonstop thereafter!

      <description>Today’s release marks a significant milestone for Windows Azure. To date, Windows Azure has been a platform that allows developers to build and run applications across Microsoft’s global datacenters – the key emphasis has been on “applications”. Windows Azure has not been a platform for providing the underlying infrastructure for running your own virtual machine – this has been a key pain point for many customers looking to move to the cloud that Microsoft has heard loud and clear.</description>

      <description>Recently Steve Marx and I spent a few hours working on a best practices document for Windows Azure. As expected, this was a fun and educational experience – plenty of goofing around, but also some really good discussion on things to think about when building applications for Windows Azure. One of the items we discussed is a better approach for sleeping inside the Worker Role when pulling from queues. Rather than defaulting to a retry every 10 seconds we decided that the best approach is to exponentially back-off on your queue reads while capping it with an upper bound.</description>

I was querying based on partition and row keys and, if no data matched the statement, I received an HTTP 404: Resource Not Found exception.
I was initially puzzled. Shouldn’t I receive an empty set or null instead?</description>

      <description>I’ve spent a fair amount of time thinking about the right title for this post. Steve Marx was clever with Career vNext, Sriram Krishnan waxed poetic with On Leaving Microsoft, and Brad Abrams just came out and talked about My Last Day at Microsoft. Yet no matter how it’s phrased it comes down to one thing: leaving Microsoft.
I can honestly say that I never thought this day would come. Working for Microsoft has been a dream come true – brilliant colleagues, interesting opportunities, and inspiring technologies.</description>

      <description>If you follow my blog or on Twitter then you know that I’m passionate about using services running in Windows Azure to power mobile applications. To effectively run mobile services for mobile apps you need a platform that is responsive to a global audience and able to scale to the needs of your user base – Windows Azure provides these capabilities.
As part of the refresh of the WindowsAzure.com we have also provided additional information about mobile scenarios – it’s worth taking a look.</description>

      <description>Recently I wrote a WCF service that fronted an on-premises SQL Server database for an MVC application running in a Window Azure Web Role. There are a number of ways I could have approached this scenario; I decided to use the netTcpRelayBinding via the Windows Azure Service Bus for the following reasons:
  I needed optimal performance (i.e. TCP over HTTP).
  I wanted to reuse existing connections (rather than opening many connections).</description>

      <description>Yes, that title is a mouthful. But this title is as cryptic as the error that can get generated when trying to install a NuGet package:

      <description>A couple days ago I wrote a post on outsourcing user authentication in a Windows Phone application, demonstrating how easy it is to leverage the Windows Azure Access Control service in your Windows Phone application. The solution is built using a set of NuGet packages that our team has built for Windows Phone + Windows Azure – they provide a similar development experience by allowing you to better manage dependencies and compose great application experiences on the Windows Phone.</description>

The Phone.Identity.AccessControl.BasePage NuGet package includes a control for Window Phone that allows your phone applications to outsource user authentication to the Windows Azure Access Control service (ACS).</description>

      <description>Earlier this week we released the Windows Azure SDK 1.6, which includes a lot of great updates to the emulators, tools for Visual Studio, and libraries. One of my favorite additions is a new way to get a management certificate installed into Windows Azure and onto your machine. You can now browse to https://windows.azure.com/download/publishprofile.aspx and login with your Live ID; this process will do two things:

      <description>If you’ve been paying attention to the Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone (or my twitter feed) the last couple weeks, you’ve probably noticed something about NuGet packages. We’ve been building a lot of Windows Phone and Windows Azure NuGet packages that, when composed together, give you the ability to quickly build some cool applications. To highlight this, here’s a short video that shows how you can enable push notification support in a brand new Windows Phone 7.</description>

I needed a way to do this quickly and easily, and with a little help from friends on Twitter (particularly a suggestion from @bertcraven) I found a nice way to accomplish this using the SyndicationFeed in System.ServiceModel.Syndication.
I’ve detailed the steps below, but if you want to get to the heart of it then here’s the code to get this working:</description>

      <description>Now that we can get our hands on the Windows Developer Preview of Windows 8, I’m sure everyone is excited to start building applications! For many of us, this means that we’ll want to install all of the great Windows Azure tools on our Windows Developer Preview machine – especially if we plan to take advantage of the new Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows 8. However, there are a few things we’ll need to do in order to get things to work.</description>

I had the great fortune to work with John Shewchuk – Technical Fellow at Microsoft – as he demonstrated a vision for how identity in Windows Azure can enable great experiences in Windows 8. I wanted to quickly provide some background on the components of the sample application he showed called Margie’s Travel.
Margie’s Travel is a sample travel application that demonstrates how you can track and manage your trips across multiple Windows 8 machines using a combination of technologies in Windows Azure and Windows 8.</description>

  Printf(“HERE”) in the Cloud
  Lightweight Tracing to Windows Azure Tables
  ELMAH (Error Logging Modules and Handlers) itself is extremely useful, and with a few simple modifications can provide a very effective way to handle application-wide error logging for your ASP.</description>

      <description>The Windows Azure Toolkit for iOS provides an easy and convenient way of accessing Windows Azure storage from iOS-based applications.
The toolkit works in two ways – the toolkit can be used to access Windows Azure storage directly, or alternatively, can go through a proxy service known as the Cloud Ready package. The Cloud Ready code is the same code as used in the WP7 toolkit for Windows Azure (found here) and negates the need for the developer to store the Azure storage credentials locally on the device.</description>

Originally I used OneNote to create screen clippings of all the images in the post, then I pasted them into Live Writer. This is my normal practice for blog posts. Unfortunately, when I published, there ended up being a mismatch between the files stored in blob storage and those included in my blog post. However, when I updated the blog post and made actual JPEGs for each image (instead of screen clippings), everything worked fine.</description>

Since the tools shipped the same day as the show we literally only had an hour or so before the show to pull together a demonstration of some of the new capabilities. I think we did a reasonably good job, but I’d like to further clarify a few things in this post.</description>

  https://github.com/microsoft-dpe/watoolkitios-samples
  https://github.com/microsoft-dpe/watoolkitios-doc
  One of the important updates is guidance—via the sample application—on how to use Windows Azure Queues.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, Fredrik Olsson opened a pull request against our GitHub repository for the Windows Azure Toolkit for iOS. A pull request provides a way to tell others about changes you’ve made to a repository – by sending me a pull request, Fredrik was notifying me of his updates so that I could review and, if appropriate, merge them to the main repository.
Today I merged Fredrik’s pull request.</description>

      <description>Today’s release of the Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone 7 (v1.2.1) has two important updates:
  Support for Visual Basic
  Bug fixes
  You can download the latest drop here: http://watoolkitwp7.codeplex.com/releases/view/61952
Visual Basic
When we released on Monday we did not include updated project templates for Visual Basic – turns out that creating these project templates takes a long time, and we did not have enough cycles to complete it in time.</description>

      <description>I’ve been really pleased with our delivery cadence for the Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone 7. We first launched (v1.0) on March 23, 2011 – this launch included VS project templates, class libraries for storage and membership services, a sample application, and documentation. We had excellent coverage by Mary Jo Foley, InfoQ, and others. On April 12, 2011—during MIX11—we shipped an update (v1.1) that provided support for Microsoft Push Notification Services running in Windows Azure (we also shipped some bug fixes).</description>

      <description>At MIX11 we released the Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone 7 v1.1.0, which included out-of-the-box support for the Microsoft Push Notification Service (MPNS) for Windows Phone. The MPNS provides an efficient way for an application to register itself for updates that are pushed directly to the phone rather than writing the application to frequently poll a web service to look for pending notifications. This has the benefit of reducing the impact on your phone battery, as polling results in the device radio turning on frequently.</description>

      <description>IMPORTANT UPDATE:
 Since the initial launch of the Windows Azure Toolkit for iOS, we’ve not only updated &amp;amp; changed the library, but we’ve also renamed the repository. For the latest information, please visit our github repository at http://github.com/microsoft-dpe/ – from here you can get access to the iOS library, Android library, and all the additional tools we’ve made available.
 I am extremely excited to announce the immediate availability of the Windows Azure Toolkit for iOS!</description>

These things generally take a month or so from the time you finish writing them, which is often challenging in a services world.

      <description>I often hear from people that they want to try out the Virtual Machine Role (VM Role for short) but cannot find it in the Windows Azure portal and don’t see the option in Visual Studio. This is because it is still in beta and requires you to request access—and receive acceptance—into the program. Fortunately, we make it very easy to get accepted – essentially request access, wait a week, and you’re in.</description>

The February 2011 update of the Windows Azure Platform Training Kit includes several updates and bug fixes for the hands-on labs. Most of the updates were focused on supporting the new Windows Azure AppFabric February CTP and the new portal experience for AppFabric Caching, Access Control, and the Service Bus. The specific content that was updated in this release includes:

      <description>Prior to the release of the Windows Azure 1.3 SDK, Web roles hosted your application in IIS Hosted Web Core (HWC). While there were certainly ways to extend HWC, for the most part you were stuck with a single application bound to no more than a single HTTP or HTTPS endpoint. This model enabled only a minimal number of configurations, and prevented you from fully benefiting from the full capabilities of IIS.</description>

      <title>Managing the SecureString in the DataCacheSecurity Constructor</title>

      <guid>https://www.wadewegner.com/2011/02/managing-the-securestring-in-the-datacachesecurity-constructor/</guid>
      <description>If you take a good look at the latest Release Notes for the Windows Azure AppFabric CTP February Release – or if you jump directly into the new SDK and try to programmatically configure the Caching client – you’ll quickly discover that the DataCacheSecurity class now requires a System.Security.SecureString instead of a string.
The reason for this change in the DataCacheSecurity constructor is to reduce the time that an unencrypted string remains in memory.</description>

      <description>Pardon the indulgence, but this post is not related to Windows Azure, cloud computing, or technology whatsoever. Instead, it’s a celebration of my wonderful family, and the fun we have.
It all started one morning with a simple email from my sister. It degraded into a war of “poetry” that, to this day, is still unresolved. It’s become one of those things that we never talk about in person, but is resurrected over email by my mother.</description>

      <description>One of the most common workloads I hear about from customers and developers is video encoding in Windows Azure. There are certainly many ways to perform video encoding in Windows Azure – in fact, at PDC 2009 I was joined by Mark Richards of Origin Digital who discussed their video transcoding solution on Windows Azure – but until the release of Windows Azure 1.3 SDK, and in particular Startup Tasks and elevated privileges, it was complicated.</description>

      <description>I recently built an application where I wanted to write some arbitrary text onto a video. I was using Expression Encoder 4 and had a difficult time finding some examples and documentation, aside from some basic MSDN documentation on the MediaItem class. I was eventually able to figure it out, but it took a little time. Even though the end result is not particularly glamorous, I thought I’d save you some time and share what I learned.</description>

      <description>With the Windows Azure SDK 1.3 comes full support for IIS in web roles, giving your web roles the ability to access the full range of web service features available in IIS. This provides a lot of powerful capabilities, some of which are outlined here.
By default, the AppPool runs as the NetworkService. Go ahead and create a new Windows Azure Project, choose a web role, and hit F5 to run it in IIS.</description>

      <description>Some networks are more restrictive than others, and (much to my continual chagrin) this is especially true here at Microsoft. As I wrote and tested the post Using Web Deploy with Windows Azure for Rapid Development, I found that I was not able to use Web Deploy on port 8172; turns out that we prevent SSL traffic on any port but 443. Fortunately, it’s pretty easy to resolve this restriction by modifying the Input Endpoint values in the Service Definition.</description>

I’ve been very happy with the applications hitting the Windows Phone Marketplace – just last week I discovered an application to help me manage my Windows Home Server from the phone.</description>

      <description>As awesome as it is to have a lot of great local development tools, it’s also be difficult to setup new development environments. Downloading and installing the Windows Azure SDK is really only one step – you also have to ensure that local services are configured correctly (e.g. IIS), you may need additional SDKs (e.g. Windows Identity Foundation SDK), setup additional tools (e.g. SSMS), and so on. Not only does this take time but also organizational skills.</description>

      <description>When using Windows Azure AppFabric Caching you will have to configure the caching client to use a provisioned cache. In the past I’ve given examples of doing this using an application configuration file, but there are times where you may want to programmatically configure the caching client. Fortunately, it’s really quite easy and straight forward.
Caching Client Code
  // define the cache details
  string serviceUrl = &amp;ldquo;YOURNAMESPACE.</description>

There have been a host of announcements and releases over the last month for the Windows Azure Platform. It started at the Professional Developers Conference (PDC) in Redmond, where we announced new services such as Windows Azure AppFabric Caching and SQL Azure Reporting, as well as new features for Windows Azure, such as VM Role, Admin mode, RDP, Full IIS, and a new portal experience.</description>

      <description>The Windows Azure AppFabric Service Bus uses a class called TransportClientEndpointBehavior to specify the credentials for a particular endpoint. There are four options available to you: Unauthenticated, SimpleWebToken, SharedSecret, and SAML. For details, take a look at the CredentialType member. The first three are pretty well described and documented – in fact, if you’ve spent any time at all looking at the Service Bus, you’ve probably seen the following code:</description>

      <description>I’ve spent the last few days refactoring a web application to leverage SQL Server via Entity Framework 4.0 (EF4) in preparation for migrating it to SQL Azure. It’s a neat application, and a great example of how to fully encapsulate your data tier (the previous version had issues due to tight coupling between the data and web tier). More on this soon.
So, when I deployed my database to SQL Azure (using the SQL Azure Migration Wizard) I was confounded by the following error:</description>

      <description>A couple months ago I wrote a post on how to host WCF services in IIS that expose themselves as endpoints on the Windows Azure AppFabric Service Bus. The principal challenge in this scenario is that IIS/WAS relies on message-based activation and will only launch the host after the first request comes in. However, until the host is launched the service will not connect to the Service Bus, and consequently will never receive a message.</description>

      <description>Last week I spent some time setting up Windows Server AppFabric Cache in anticipation of additional tasks this week. The first task is configuring an ASP.NET web application to use Windows Server AppFabric Caching for the Session State Provider. This allows the web application to spread session objects across the entire cache cluster, resulting in greater scalability.
Below is a walkthrough on how to configure this scenario. In addition to this post, I recommend you take a look at this article on MSDN.</description>

      <description>Today the Windows Azure AppFabric team released an update to the SDK. This release is what’s called a QFE (quick fix engineering) update that’s intended to address bugs or breaking issues. To my knowledge, this is the first QFE for the Windows Azure AppFabric. In this case, the QFE fixed one bug:
 Adding a Ws2007HttpRelayBinding endpoint that uses TransportWithMessageCredential security mode to a ServiceHost that also exposes a local MEX endpoint (not visible through the Service Bus) using the mexHttpsBinding, causes the local MEX endpoint to stop working.</description>

Based on the size of these files, I was quite close to running out of room on my Windows Media Center. So, I decided to encode the files as WMVs. Huge size reduction with very little quality loss.
I decided to use Microsoft Expression Encoder 3 – a great tool.</description>

 What is the Windows Azure AppFabric?
With AppFabric, Microsoft is delivering services that enable developers to build and manage composite applications more easily for both server and cloud environments. Windows Azure AppFabric, formerly called “.NET Services”, provides cloud-based services that help developers connect applications and services across Windows Azure, Windows Server and a number of other platforms.</description>

      <description>The other day I attempted to build a sample application that communicated with the Azure AppFabric Service Bus by creating a Console application targeting the .NET Framework 4.0. After adding a reference to Microsoft.ServiceBus I was bewildered to see that my Service Bus bindings in the system.ServiceModel section were not recognized.
I soon realized that the issue was the machine.config file. When you install the Azure AppFabric SDK the relevant WCF extensions are added to the .</description>

      <description>On an email thread today, someone was looking for suggestions on how to start a job simultaneously across multiple worker roles running in Windows Azure. For example, image you have ten worker roles already running and, through the command of an admin or user, you want to “release the hounds!”
Definitely an interesting scenario, and many different ways to approach it. Initial ideas and thoughts centered around using Windows Azure storage tables or blobs – in fact, Steve Marx quickly threw out some pseudo code highlighting a reasonable way to approach the problem:</description>

      <description>At MIX10, Jon Box – a Senior Architect Evangelist with Microsoft – spoke with SocialWendy about Internet Explorer 8. In addition to highlighting the fact that IE8 makes the Internet easier, safer, and faster, Jon talks about three unique capabilities found in IE8:
  Accelerators
  Visual Search
  Web slices
  Furthermore, Jon highlighted how a web slice allows a user to subscribe to a piece of content on a web page, and also explain how a user can leverage an accelerator – such as Walmart’s accelerator – to make it easier to search for information and goods on the Internet.</description>

      <description>If you take a look at the official Windows Azure platform website, you’ll see two definitions for the Windows Azure platform AppFabric (hereafter referred to as the Azure AppFabric) prominently called out:
  “&amp;hellip; connects cloud services and on-premises applications.”
  “&amp;hellip; helps developers connect applications and services in the cloud or on-premises.”
  While the purpose of the Azure AppFabric seems clear to me – enable developers to connect applications and services – there are a couple things that generally cause confusion: execution and branding.</description>

      <description>I love gaming. Long before the death match 95 tournament with Windows 95 that featured Bill Gates in a trench coat, I was playing computer games. Two of the first games I remember playing were The Ancient Art of War and Montezuma’s Revenge – simple but fun. I soon became a Sierra devotee, and devoured games such as Kings Quest, Heroes Quest (renamed Quest for Glory), Space Quest, Police Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry (just don’t tell my dad).</description>

      <description>George Huey has done it again! He has just published some significant updates to the SQL Azure Migration Wizard.
Previously, I’ve described the SQL Azure Migration Wizard as a tool that helps you migrate your SQL Server database into SQL Azure. This is still true, but now, thanks to updates made by George Huey, you can also migrate from SQL Azure-to-SQL Server and SQL Azure-to-SQL Azure. These are significant updates to the tool!</description>

Our goal was to provide an overview of everything announced at the Professional Developers Conference (PDC) 2009. We made a ton of announcements, and I recommend you check out the Microsoft PDC website for more information, including videos and decks from all the presentations.

      <description>It’s hard to believe that the Professional Developers Conference (PDC) 2009 is less than two weeks away. It doesn’t seem that long ago that I sat behind the stage at PDC 2008 providing support for the RedPrairie keynote with Bob Muglia and spoke in a breakout session with Jack Greenfield on Multi-Enterprise Business Applications. I’ll be back again this year, and I’m giving another talk – this time on lessons learned when migrating applications to the Windows Azure platform.</description>

      <description>One of the advantages to the approach our teams building the Windows Azure Platform have taken is flexibility. Recently, when I spoke at the Day of Cloud presentation, I recall Don Schwarz from Google making these two points (you can see video of his talk here):
  You can’t spin up your own threads in Google App Engine.
  You build your applications according to how Google thinks your apps should be built (the argument being that Google knows how to run highly available services at scale, which I think is a fair statement).</description>

      <description>Note: This is a guest post from George Huey, Architect Evangelist in the Developer and Platform Evangelism group.
When you upload your data into SQL Azure, SQL Azure replicates your data to three different locations in order to provide triple redundancy. Therefore, it needs a little more time to get the data in the proper places.
One of the things that we found out during a series of Windows Azure Platform Migration Labs held in the Chicago MTC is that you cannot upload hundreds of thousands of records without giving SQL Azure time to catch up.</description>

This past year, the City of Chicago needed to quickly build out an interactive map for the event – and when I say quickly, I mean it.</description>

The number one request for the migration wizard was the ability to replicate your data up to SQL Azure (in addition to the SQL schema, which it already does).</description>

      <description>In my opinion, SQL Azure is the &amp;ldquo;secret sauce&amp;rdquo; of the Windows Azure Platform. Through SQL Azure, you have the ability to store your data in a true cloud-based relational database. It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as deploying your database to SQL Azure and updating your connection string to point to the new database - done! I think this really provides a core differentiator between the Windows Azure Platform and other cloud vendors.</description>

I think we can all agree – and if not, please let me know why – that the Entity Framework provides some awesome capabilities – mapping your conceptual schema to your data schema, isolation from the relational database and database schema, change tracking and identity resolution, full query comprehension and optimization, and more.</description>

Please take a look at an announcement recently made by Glen (Software) Smith announcing that the Commerce Server 2007 book is finished. You may (or may not) recall that this book was originally going to be published by Wiley (aka Wrox), but that it was cancelled for a number of reasons. Consequently, efforts on the book essentially stalled until Glen stepped up last fall and volunteered to see it through fruition.</description>

      <description>This past Tuesday was the inaugural meeting of the Windows Azure Cloud Computing User Group in Chicago, IL. The mission of this new user group is to provide a forum for developers and architects to discuss Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s vision of Software + Services (S+S), and in particular the Azure Services Platform. This user group is sponsored by Neudesic, and the presenter for the first meeting was Bryce Calhoun, Director at Neudesic. Despite the snow and difficult driving conditions, the meeting was well attended by many members of the local community.</description>

      <description>I had the honor and privilege to present with Jack Greenfield at PDC2008 this past week. We discussed our use of the Azure Services Platform - the new Microsoft cloud services layer recently announced at PDC2008 - to build Multi-Enterprise Business Applications (MEBAs). As Jack says in the presentation, the Azure Services Platform has the potential to bring about a resurgence on business-to-business (B2B) in a way that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been possible before.</description>

      <description>… and I can’t wait!
For the last two months I’ve been working on a project that uses the “Windows Cloud OS” and “Cloud Services”, and I can’t wait until we disclose all the details at PDC 2008. Expect to see a significant amount of details regarding this cloud computing project as we get closer and closer to PDC.
In the meantime, enjoy a sneak peak at the work done by one of our ad agencies – can you feel the excitement?</description>

      <description>I find myself doing this over and over again, so I figured it would be worthwhile to post. Below you’ll find a really useful way for installing a Windows O/S from a bootable USB device. I am particularly dependent on USB drives, as I have a Lenovo X61 Tablet that doesn’t have a CD/DVD-ROM (unless I’m docked, but I’m hardly in the office).
A couple of notes:
 This assumes you’re running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 I’ve tested by installing the following O/S’s: Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 You must have a machine capable of booting from a USB drive  Without further ado, here are the steps:</description>

      <description>As I am new to Illinois, I recently started looking around to find out about some of the local user groups. My friend and colleague, Dave Bost (developer evangelist and co-host of The Thirsty Developer), recently sent me the following list of user groups in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. I&amp;rsquo;m not yet sure if this is an exhaustive list or if I&amp;rsquo;m missing some key groups. Please let me know if I&amp;rsquo;m missing any.</description>

      <description>I know that Twitter is nothing new and that many of you are already using it, but until recently I had managed to resist. However, upon joining Microsoft and getting to know my evangelist peers, I found Twitter to be a great way to both keep in touch and coordinate with my friends and coworkers. Furthermore, having recently moved from Colorado to Illinois, I found that Twitter is also a great way to keep in touch with distant and remote friends.</description>

      <description>I have long been a proponent of working and developing in an environment that matches your production systems. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that developing on the same O/S takes away a lot of the unknowns and guess work that occurs when you deploy from a traditional workstation O/S (like XP or Vista) to a server O/S (like Windows Server 2003 or 2008). Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, Windows XP and Vista are fantastic O/S&amp;rsquo;s and appropriate for all kinds of development; yet, when you&amp;rsquo;re working with products like BizTalk, SharePoint, or Commerce Server, it make sense to use the same server O/S.</description>

      <description>Today I decided to install the x64 version of Windows Server 2008 EE w/ Hyper-V on my Dell D830 laptop. I will post about the experience later (it was awesome!); for now, I want to specifically mention how I was able to get the wireless working.
I should have done my due diligence prior to installing Windows Server 2008, but I like to live dangerously! After the installation was complete (which was simple and fast), I noticed that the wireless adapter was not installed.</description>

      <description>I have been meaning to post an update on the book, but with the new job and move to Illinois it&amp;rsquo;s been difficult to find the time. Since Max mentioned on his blog that the Professional Commerce Server book to be published by Wiley (aka Wrox) has been canceled, I think it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate for me to take the time and add a few details.
Fundamentally, the book was canceled because it was not completed in the allotted timeframe (nor the extended timeframe).</description>

      <description>I recently accepted a job as an Architect Evangelist for Microsoft, working with the central region Developer &amp;amp; Platform Evangelism (DPE) team out of Downers Grove, IL. I am extremely excited - this is a dream come true! I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of my career as a IT consultant largely focused on Microsoft technologies, and I think this role will really allow me to focus on my interests and passions.
The story behind how I first learned about the role, and how I came to get an offer, is long and (probably) pretty boring.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m currently porting a web-based timesheet application to an ASP.NET AJAX Futures Web Application with the .NET Framework 3.5. In writing the application, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to adhere to a number of practices:

      <description>A neat trick to help you diagnose troublesome security problems. Modify your the audit settings for process tracking, so that successes and failures are logged in your Security log.
 Go to Start -&amp;gt; Run. Type: gpedit.msc Expand Local Computer Policy -&amp;gt; Computer Configuration -&amp;gt; Windows Settings -&amp;gt; Security Settings -&amp;gt; Local Policies -&amp;gt; Audit Policy.  4. Review the &amp;ldquo;Audit process tracking&amp;rdquo; policy. 5. Right-click the &amp;ldquo;Audit process tracking&amp;rdquo; policy, and select Properties.</description>

      <description>Joe Shirey, an Architect Evangelist for Microsoft, has posted an eight-part series that discusses the Microsoft Certified Architect (MCA) program. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me and have spent time reviewing the Microsoft Certified Architect Programs web site, and wanted a more in-depth, personal understanding of the process, you should take the time to read Joe&amp;rsquo;s posts in their entirety. Joe is one of the original participants of the MCA program, and offers a lot of insight into the process.</description>

 Developing with Microsoft Commerce Server 2007 Part 1: Secure By Default     In this post, Søren highlights the high-level of security that has gone into Commerce Server 2007, calling it &amp;ldquo;both a blessing and a curse.</description>

Summary: &amp;ldquo;This white paper explores challenges that arise when you migrate from an Oracle 7.3 database or later to SQL Server 2005. It describes the implementation differences of database objects, SQL dialects, and procedural code between the two platforms. The entire migration process using SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle (SSMA Oracle) is explained in depth, with a special focus on converting database objects and PL/SQL code.</description>

MSDN Architecture Center
This is a great central hub for architectural information related to MSFT technologies, platforms, and products. There are also a number of excellent architects that deal with topics such as service oriented architecture (SOA), Software + Services (S+S, SaaS), security, enterprise architecture, agile development, and more.</description>

I found these links after visiting the blog of Hanu Kommalapati, an MSFT architect evangelist. He links to the aspiring architects webcasts himself, as well as Mohammad&amp;rsquo;s blog.
Here are links to the webcasts, as well as some high-level notes on the various topics discussed.
Note: you may think that these webcasts would focus on architecture from the MSFT perspective, but really the presenters do a great job of staying mostly agnostic to technology and platform.</description>

      <description>It only took me two or three months, but I finally updated my Silverlight Hangman application. It was originally written an earlier version of Silverlight 1.1 alpha, and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken the time to update it.
The only things I had to do was switch out the Silverlight.js file and change the value of &amp;ldquo;Hidden&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Collapsed&amp;rdquo; for the &amp;ldquo;Visibility&amp;rdquo; property of objects. Otherwise I was able to use the same files in the Beta 2 version of Visual Studio 2008.</description>

I previously blogged about Commerce Server 2007 and Operational Monitoring, and indicated that there is no native OpsMgr 2007 pack for Commerce Server 2007 (although there will be one some day). For now, we have to convert the MOM 2005 pack.</description>

It literally took longer to install all the Windows XP updates than it did to install Visual Studio 2005 Team Developer Edition. Amazing!
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s time for SP 3?</description>

      <description>Operational monitoring (OM) is a practice that is sorely underused, in my opinion. OM is a performance and event monitoring practice that allows you to respond to errors and gain insight into machines on your network. Microsoft has two flagship products for operational monitoring: Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) 2005 and System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) 2007. Through MOM and SCOM you can monitor your Microsoft server products, such as SQL Server, Web Sites, and even Commerce Server 2007.</description>

Tom is a senior consultant with the Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS), and is particularly focused on e-commerce and the Commerce Server product.</description>

      <description>As I was putting together the demonstration for the talk I&amp;rsquo;m giving tomorrow on BizTalk Server R2 and the WCF Adapters I had to do a few things to get some basic examples working, as this was a brand new virtual environment. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d document some of the actions I had to take.
1. Registering the &amp;ldquo;WCF-BasicHttp&amp;rdquo; adapter.
After creating and deploying an orchestration for use with the &amp;ldquo;WCF-BasicHttp&amp;rdquo; adapter, I received the following error:</description>

      <description>In preparation for the talk I am giving tomorrow on BizTalk Server R2 and the WCF Adapters, I thought I would post some notes on how to setup and configure a BizTalk Server 2006 R2 development environment. The installation is really quite straightforward. Start with a relatively clean machine (I suggest you use a virtual machine, as these are all beta bits). My (virtual) machine had the following installed before I started the R2 installation:</description>

      <description>I was able to use the XML sample documents that come with eConnect (C:Program FilesMicrosoft Great PlainseConnect9XML Sample DocumentsIncoming) to write some test data into my GP database using the eConnect 9.0 adapters for BizTalk Server 2006. I setup a test environment using the TWO database for Great Plains, and through the adapter was able to insert data. Feeling that I had made some good progress, I shutdown my machine (they are all virtualized environments) and went home for the night.</description>

Fortunately, my friend Rich Finn just passed along this useful link:

      <description>Somehow I missed the announcement that SP1 was released for Virtual Server 2005 R2. Given that I run nearly all my development (and some non-development) environments on R2, I&amp;rsquo;m surprised I didn&amp;rsquo;t catch wind of SP1!
You can download SP1 here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=BC49C7C8-4840-4E67-8DC4-1E6E218ACCE4&amp;amp;displaylang=en. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to note that Vista flavors are listed as supported host operating systems, yet include a &amp;ldquo;non-Production only&amp;rdquo; caveat.
I run Virtual Server 2005 R2 on Vista Business without any problems (well, if you know some tricks).</description>

      <description>One of the things I learned while setting up a virtual Team Foundation Server (TFS) environment is that there are definitely a few &amp;ldquo;gotchas.&amp;rdquo; I encountered one of these while writing up some documentation on how to integrate a Web Application Project (WAP).
Before I began documenting the procedure, I went through and confirmed that everything would work. When I was finished, I figured I would delete the Team Project and start over.</description>

      <description>Although it has its share of issues, I am a big fan of Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server (known as TFS for short). Often you&amp;rsquo;ll see people only leverage it for a source code repository, but if that&amp;rsquo;s all you are using it for then you are missing out. In addition to storing source code, TFS also supports:
  Code analysis
  Build automation
  Support for continuous integration</description>

      <description>I started blogging as a way of archiving tips-and-tricks I learn everyday so that I can go refer back to the post rather than having to constantly re-learn everything. I have also tried to document ways I have solved various problems and issues that I am confronted with while working with various technologies. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that, originally, this blog was a purely selfish endeavor - I wasn&amp;rsquo;t motivated by any altruistic reasons, I simply wanted to have a way to archive things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so that I could refer back to them.</description>

      <description>One of the first things I do after installing Vista is turn off UAC (ooh, I can already feel the criticism). I just can abide having to authorize every single action I take on the computer. It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to ask me to confirm a change to IIS or a service running on my machine, but don&amp;rsquo;t make me authorize the deletion of files on the operating system! If I clicked delete and confirmed the deletion, just delete it!</description>

      <description>I got caught up yesterday with a problem I should have recognized right away, but for whatever reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t put the pieces together until it was pointed out by one of my co-workers.
I was writing a BizTalk Server 2006 orchestration that, amongst other things, sends a request to a remote server. The remote server has an application installed that accesses these requests and initiates a few local (and unimportant) processes.</description>

      <description>I came across a frustrating interesting problem today where the BizTalk Server 2006 Configuration wizard would fail every time I applied a new configuration.
Unlike a typical BizTalk developer environment (which usually consists of BizTalk and SQL Server on the same machine), this environment consisted of two separate machines: one BizTalk Server 2006 and one SQL Server 2005 (i.e. the BizTalk databases are stored on the SQL Server). Additionally, this is a virtual environment and both machines were cloned from the same base Windows Server 2003 R2 template.</description>

      <description>I often get asked about how development environments should be configured and what practices should be implemented when building a Commerce Server 2007 solution. I have found this to be a difficult question to answer, as everyone has their own preferences and &amp;ldquo;best-practices&amp;rdquo; when it comes to development environments. Additionally, we are often constrained by the following variables:
 Relative importance placed on time, cost, and quality Available development and QA skills Software development methodology Scope and function of the application  Over my career I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a number of things I try to have when building a Commerce Server solution (or any enterprise-level application).</description>

I thought I&amp;rsquo;d go ahead and document the steps I took when I setup my development environment. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to come back here and update the content, so that it stays pertinent as updates are released.

It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty slick (albeit graphically retarded) Silverlight application. It uses Microsoft Silverlight 1.1 Alpha (for Windows), and I built it on the work I did devising a strategy to (consistently) win hangman.</description>

In an effort to distract myself from more productive endeavors, I started playing Hangman on The Free Dictionary Web site today. They have an outstanding plugin that you can also add to your Google homepage (which is actually how I discovered it). The interface allows you to simply type the letter into the guess box (if you look below you&amp;rsquo;ll see that my last guess was the letter &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo;), and it updates it as you go:</description>

      <description>Years ago I made a serious mistake when I installed, and briefly used, iTunes &amp;ndash; I gave it the ability to reorganize my music folders! Since then, all my nicely organized and sorted directories of (legally obtained) digital music have been disorganized and confused.
For example, I used to have a directory named &amp;ldquo;U2&amp;rdquo; where all my music for the group U2 was stored. However, iTunes decided that my organization structure was too simple, and broke it out into folders derived from the contributing artists.</description>

      <description>My cousin Kai just got married yesterday in Maine. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to make it, but my parents and sister were able to fly up and attend. By all accounts, it was a fantastic wedding and I wish we could have made it, but with a month old baby (not to mention her two-year-old sister) we just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like we could handle the trip. And, given the multiple layovers and missed flights my parents encountered along the way, I think we made the right choice.</description>

      <description>It was a slower-than-normal week in the world of Commerce Server; that is, slow for everyone except Max. The man is a Commerce Server animal!
The general slowness and lack of blog posts can probably be attributed to the Worldwide Partner Conference in Denver, CO., this past week. Lots of activity. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend. I&amp;rsquo;ve been swamped with BizTalk projects and dirty diapers.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what I read regarding Commerce Server this past week &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I was performing an advanced search on Google Blog Search (posts that include &amp;ldquo;commerce server 2007&amp;rdquo; over the past week) when allow of a sudden I started getting the following error:
Que?! What is it with me and search engines?!
Something very similar happened awhile back when I was searching Yahoo. I got the infamous &amp;ldquo;error 999&amp;rdquo;, which evidently is most often caused by bandwidth limiting that Yahoo! invokes to prevent DoS (Denial of Service) attacks and automated processes that overload their systems.</description>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally joined the 21st century, and purchased a Samsung Blackjack. After waiting a two agonizing days, it finally arrived. Man, it&amp;rsquo;s a beauty!
I&amp;rsquo;ll spare you a review of all it&amp;rsquo;s features (this is covered in agonizing detail elsewhere), but there are a couple tidbits I&amp;rsquo;d like to share.
The Blackjack runs Windows Mobile 5.0 with the Messaging and Security Feature Pack. One of the neatest features that this supports is Exchange ActiveSync w/ Direct Push Technology.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to start posting an aggregation of notable Commerce Server blog and forum postings. I&amp;rsquo;ve never found that Google or Technorati do a great job of searching or summarizing blog topic discussions, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to do my best to relate what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the Commerce Server community. Mostly, these posts come from people listed in my Commerce Server blogroll, as well as the Commerce Server forums.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started working on a project that integrates into Great Plains 9.0 using eConnect. Not having done this using BizTalk Server 2006, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d document some of my observations and the steps I took.
To begin, I was able to get eConnect for GP (en_econnect_for_gp.zip) through my MSDN subscription. If you have Great Plains 9.0, then you should be able to get your hands on this package. When you unzip the package, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice two files:</description>

      <description>I just recently started a new BizTalk Server 2006 project in which I created a custom pipeline component to assist in the compression and decompression of messages. The plan is to have a receive location monitor a folder via the File adapter, and when a zip file is uploaded via FTP from a 3rrd party process, the receive location will use the custom pipeline component , via a receive pipeline, to decompress the file and publish the message to the MessageBox.</description>

      <description>As was announced yesterday, Service Pack 1 has been released for Commerce Server 2007. This service pack includes support for Windows Vista, the ability to create web application projects in Visual Studio 2005, performance and security enhancements, and a slew of bug fixes.
I have detailed the process for installing SP1 and upgrading your CS sites in the following posts: Commerce Server 2007 Service Pack 1 (SP1) Walkthrough and Commerce Server 2007 Upgrade Wizard (post SP1 install) Walkthrough.</description>

      <description>In my previous post, I detailed the process for installing the Commerce Server 2007 SP1. In this post, I have created a walkthrough for the Commerce Server 2007 Upgrade Wizard. The upgrade wizard should be run for all of your Commerce Server 2007 sites immediately after you have installed SP1. So, before you begin this process, be sure you have successfully installed SP1.
(Note: I created this walkthrough, along with verbose screen shots and text, largely for documentation I am delivering to clients.</description>

      <description>As a Commerce Server developer, you are bound to come across a situation where the smart client business user applications (e.g. the Catalog Manager, Catalog and Inventory Schema Manager, Customer and Orders Manager, and Marketing Manager) do not satisfy a business requirement, need to reflect a company&amp;rsquo;s brand or style, or your business users simply want it changed.
Fortunately, you can get the full C# source code for the business user applications (except for the Catalog and Inventory Schema Manager; see Max&amp;rsquo;s comment in this thread) through the Commerce Server 2007 Partner SDK.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally taking the time to highlight two blogging widgets that I have been using on my blog: ClustrMap and whos.amung.us. These aren&amp;rsquo;t the only widgets I use, but of the half-dozen scattered throughout my blog these are (arguably) the least well-known (at least, I don&amp;rsquo;t see them very often).
The first is ClustrMap. ClustrMap is a mapping widget that embeds itself into your blog and visually displays the location of your various visitors.</description>

      <description>Max Akbar, Commerce Server expert and former Senior Product Manager for the Commerce Server team, has announced his new training company and web site. Training resources include video tutorials, DVDs, PowerPoint presentations, codes samples, and on-site training. You can find more information on his Web site at http://www.commerceservertraining.com/.
Max recently left Microsoft to consult and train companies using Commerce Server. While this is a huge loss for Microsoft, it is a huge win for the Commerce Server community as there has been a noticeable lack of training resources available.</description>

Every time I attempt to search, I get the error &amp;ldquo;Sorry, Unable to process request at this time &amp;ndash; error 999.&amp;rdquo; This has been occurring for at least the past 30 minutes. However, I pinged a friend of mine, Brad Younge, and he can search just fine. Quite strange!
A quick search via Google (and no, I&amp;rsquo;ve never received an &amp;ldquo;unable to process request at this time&amp;rdquo; error from Google) shows that a LOT of people have this problem.</description>

      <description>One of the more manually intense steps in the installation of Commerce Server is setting up the appropriate SQL logins and Database Role User Mapping. This task can easily take 30 - 60 minutes to complete if done manually. Futhermore, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that this is the easiest step to make a mistake, which will cause problems for you down the road.
So, to make this process quicker and less prone to errors, I&amp;rsquo;ve created an SQL script that you can run against your database.</description>

      <description>Holy moly, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone script crazy!
Here&amp;rsquo;s another little script that helps with the installation of Commerce Server 2007 (perhaps when I&amp;rsquo;m all done, I&amp;rsquo;ll consolidate them all into an uber-script). This script creates the Business Management Administrator Windows groups, which are used to control authorization roles within the Authorization Manager.
This script creates four Windows groups (CatalogAdminGroup, MarketingAdminGroup, ProfilesAdminGroup, and OrdersAdminGroup) and then assigns users to those groups.
Without further ado, here&amp;rsquo;s the script:</description>

      <description>Okay, so here&amp;rsquo;s another useful script.
Commerce Server 2007 requires you to give service accounts write permissions to various files and folders. This script assigns the write permissions to the Catalog Web service, the Temporary ASP.NET folder, and the Windows Temporary folder. These permission allow you to run the Business User applications through the Business Management Web services.
In order to run this script, you must have the XCACLS.vbs file available.</description>

      <description>I was browsing one of my new favorite websites, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Script Repository, when I came upon the Add &amp;ldquo;Command Prompt Here&amp;rdquo; to Windows Explorer&amp;quot; Web page. This script adds a &amp;ldquo;Command Prompt Here&amp;rdquo; command to the Windows Explorer system menu, so that if you select the command, a command window will open up in the same folder. Nifty, eh? Yes, I know, this has been around for quite awhile and is nothing new.</description>

So, while I was going through and installing Commerce Server 2007 on a new virtual machine, I decided to script out the creation of the local user accounts. Before we get to the script, a little background &amp;hellip;
It is recommended that you create multiple accounts to handle the various roles within Commerce Server (such as the four web services, staging, etc).</description>

      <description>I awoke to see a very encouraging post from Ryan Donovan on the future of Commerce Server.
Some key points to take away:
  Microsoft is committed to their e-commerce platform, and has no plans to roll Commerce Server into another server product (for those of you who follow, there has been a lot of speculation and rumors about Microsoft not being fully committed to Commerce Server - this really helps to dispel those rumors).</description>

      <description>As a consultant, I often have to spend a great deal of time diagnosing issues that are confronting my clients. Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve used some of the tools available from Sysinternals, but I honestly never put a lot of energy or time into really learning to use them. On my most recent project, however, I&amp;rsquo;ve found them to be tremendously helpful, and I&amp;rsquo;m now a confirmed believer!
There are a number of useful tools available, and I don&amp;rsquo;t profess to have used or mastered them all.</description>

      <description>The Commerce Server team has released four white papers outlining how to use the Commerce Server adapters to export a product catalog, export an inventory catalog, export new orders, and export user profiles. If you are attempting to use the adapters (or even thinking about it), I highly encourage you to take a look at these white papers. If nothing else, they will give you a good overview of how you can make use of these adapter (I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to blog on them for awhile now, but haven&amp;rsquo;t found the time).</description>

      <description>I learned a new twist to the following error message today:
The adapter &amp;quot;SQL&amp;quot; raised an error message. Details &amp;quot;Unable to enlist in the transaction. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8004D00A)&amp;quot;.  This can occur in a scenario where your BizTalk server attempts to connect to a separate SQL Server database and execute a distributed transaction. In order for this to work the BizTalk server must have the ability to &amp;ldquo;hand-off&amp;rdquo; the transaction to SQL Server.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in a previous blog, I&amp;rsquo;ve been setting up BizTalk 2006 in a 64-bit Windows Server 2003 environment. This BizTalk solution communicates to AS/400 and Oracle, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Microsoft BizTalk Adapters for Enterprise Applications (for Oracle connectivity) as well as Microsoft BizTalk Adapters for Host Systems (for AS/400 DB2 connectivity).
Setting up these adapters has not gone extremely well in the 64-bit O/S (whereas a 32-bit O/S is quite simple to configure).</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been deploying a BizTalk 2006 solution to a x64 system and, while BizTalk 2006 itself has no problems, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of problems related to the BizTalk Adapters for Host Systems and the BizTalk Adapters for Enterprise Applications. I plan to write a number of posts in the near future discussing these problems (once we have them all resolved). In the meantime, I wanted to share this little tidbit I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about ODBC on 64-bit windows.</description>

      <description>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share this quick and dirty way to load the Adventure Works catalog into Commerce Server 2007 so that you can use it with the Starter Site. This catalog, along with the Start Site, is a great way to familiarize yourself with well designed catalog and how it interacts with Start Site.
This procedure assumes that you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded the Starter Site, and unpacked it to the default location. Also, it assumes that you&amp;rsquo;ve setup the Business Management Applications to interact correctly with the Commerce Server web services, which in turn assumes you&amp;rsquo;ve configured security for the web services through Azman.</description>

      <description>I built an XPath expression to extract the contents of an XML element. I tested this XPath in a utility I created that executes the expression, and writes the results to the file system. The XPath expression worked perfectly, and returned the contents of the XML element. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick and dirty example &amp;hellip;
My XML file:
&amp;lt;ns0:Example xmlns:ns0=&amp;quot;[http://example/](http://example/)&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ns0:Contents&amp;gt;1169861&amp;lt;/ns0:Contents&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ns0:Example&amp;gt;  And my XPath expression:
/*[local-name()=&#39;Example&#39; and namespace-uri()=&#39;http://example/&#39;]/*[local-name()=&#39;Contents&#39; and namespace-uri()=&#39;http://example/&#39;]/text()  (Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the &amp;ldquo;/text()&amp;rdquo; at the end, or you&amp;rsquo;ll get the entire element!</description>

      <description>I have started hosting this blog in a new location. Unfortunately there were some routing issues, and I think the blog was down for about two or three hours. Those problem has been corrected, and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen again (who would have guessed that the network adapter was defaulted to turn off when not being used).

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s often nice, while working with BizTalk (or any other MS product, for that matter) to have UDL files available to allow you to quickly setup your connections to various databases. A UDL file is essentially a file that saves connection information, making it available for future use.
To create a UDL file, follow these steps:
  Open a folder (or use the desktop) and create a new text file (right-click &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; New &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Text Document).</description>

I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good post showing how to configure your inventory catalog to allow for backorderable items.
I hope to see more posts from Martin in the future!</description>

As many of you are probably aware, good technical training resources for Commerce Serve 2007 are hard to come by. In no way is this meant to be a criticism of the Commerce Server product team, as they have made every effort to blog and webcast about technical topics and some of the newer features of Commerce Server.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a concept in Commerce Server (and many other products, for that matter) that&amp;rsquo;s important to understand. There are two ways to go about programming against the core systems (i.e. Catalog, Inventory, Profiles, Orders, and Marketing) in Commerce Server&amp;ndash;InProc mode and Web Service mode. Vinayak, a developer on the Commerce Server team, wrote an excellent blog about this concept (last October) as it relates to the catalog system. There are also some great code examples.</description>

      <description>I recently found myself in a situation where I had to change the computer name of a machine I had configured as a BizTalk 2006 server. The machine was actually a virtual machine that was going to be used for development, and we made numerous copies for all the developers. Consequently, each developer needed to have a computer with a unique name.
After researching the appropriate way to do this, all I could find were very manual steps.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to explain to people how the high-pitched noise emitting from my Dell Latitude D820 (which is a great computer) has been driving me crazy! Indeed, after complaining about this noise, most people actually think I have GONE crazy. But, it turns out that it&amp;rsquo;s actually a known issue. Here&amp;rsquo;s an article published by Dell:
http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?c=us&amp;amp;docid=0A7D5CD2E17F5125E0401E0A55176204&amp;amp;journalid=B141AFF2D12811DA8253D5412E975AB8&amp;amp;l=en&amp;amp;s=gen
Personally, I find it quite humorous that Dell blames the problem on Piezoelectricity, and even goes so far as to link to Wikipedia for more information.</description>

This book will be part of the Professional series, and entitled Professional Commerce Server 2007. Writing begins next week, and should be completed by the end of Q3, 2007. It should hit store shelves some time in late 2007, early 2008. A long process, yet hopefully very worthwhile!
This book will deal with advanced topics, such as:</description>

      <description>Since I use virtual machines (VMs) for development, I often find myself having to turn off the beep service on my VMs, or risk the rather of my neighbors. There are a couple of ways to do this:
  Stop the beep on/off for the particular session. Obviously, the problem with this is that once you restart your machine, the beep service will restart. Nevertheless, you can type the the following at the command line:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a project where we have two independent BizTalk 2006 clusters &amp;ndash; one at the headquarters, and one (actually, a few) at some a remote office. In order to send messages back and forth, we are using HTTP as the transport protocol.
For example, we first query an AS400/DB2 database (via the HOST adapters for BizTalk 2006) through a receive port/location. This is picked up by a subscribing send port, which posts it via HTTP to the remote office.</description>

      <description>Many applications require (or should have) direct access to the Windows Console, rather than a session on the the Windows Server. I encounter these kind of problems often, as I do all my development on virtual machines (running on Virtual Server 2005 R2) and use Remote Desktop to connect.
In order to accomplish this, call the Remote Desktop application with the following command:
mstsc /console  This will attach the Remote Desktop application directly to the system console, preventing any issues that can result from attaching to a session.</description>

      <description>One of the most common questions people ask is, how can we integrate Commerce Server 2007 with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007? Well, Henry Winkler, a consultant with Microsoft Consulting Services in Denver whom I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure to work with in the recent past, has written the following white paper:
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=2AEB1A5E-43B8-483B-8CB2-86C0E82BF0AB&amp;amp;displaylang=en
This whitepaper includes code samples that make it easy to integrate these two products together.
Thank you Henry!</description>

      <description>I came across a great blog entry today that provided the following script. This script will setup IIS with the proper configuration to allow Virtual Server 2005 R2 to function. Just run this in the command line (or create a batch file) before installing Virtual Server.
start /w pkgmgr /l:log.etw /iu:IIS-WebServerRole;IIS-WebServer;IIS-CommonHttpFeatures;IIS-StaticContent;IIS-DefaultDocument;IIS-DirectoryBrowsing;IIS-HttpErrors;IIS-HttpRedirect;IIS-ApplicationDevelopment;IIS-ASPNET;IIS-NetFxExtensibility;IIS-ASP;IIS-CGI;IIS-ISAPIExtensions;IIS-ISAPIFilter;IIS-ServerSideIncludes;IIS-HealthAndDiagnostics;IIS-HttpLogging;IIS-LoggingLibraries;IIS-RequestMonitor;IIS-HttpTracing;IIS-CustomLogging;IIS-ODBCLogging;IIS-Security;IIS-BasicAuthentication;IIS-WindowsAuthentication;IIS-DigestAuthentication;IIS-ClientCertificateMappingAuthentication;IIS-IISCertificateMappingAuthentication;IIS-URLAuthorization;IIS-RequestFiltering;IIS-IPSecurity;IIS-Performance;IIS-HttpCompressionStatic;IIS-HttpCompressionDynamic;IIS-WebServerManagementTools;IIS-ManagementConsole;IIS-ManagementScriptingTools;IIS-ManagementService;IIS-IIS6ManagementCompatibility;IIS-Metabase;IIS-WMICompatibility;IIS-LegacyScripts;IIS-LegacySnapIn;IIS-FTPPublishingService;IIS-FTPServer;IIS-FTPManagement;WAS-WindowsActivationService;WAS-ProcessModel;WAS-NetFxEnvironment;WAS-ConfigurationAPI  Note: this will pretty much install everything under IIS. I recommend that you either go through and remove some of the above settings, or go in afterwards and do so.</description>

      <description>In a previous post, I attempted to create a very simple artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the outcome of NFL games. I found that the approach I took was really no better than random guesses, as I had an average accuracy of 50%.
Consequently, I decided upon a different approach. I used the same network architecture, but I added data which allowed the network to make more accurate predictions. This time, I used the following data:</description>

      <description>Note: an updated, more accurate method can be found here.
Over the past few months, I have been playing around with artificial neural networks (ANNs) in C#. For those of you unfamiliar with ANNs, it is an attempt to programmatically reproduce the way the brain processes data.
Below is a simple ANN architecture:
On the left we have inputs (i.e. data), and on the right we have an output (i.e. the outcome).</description>

      <description>I recently had to configure a virtual machine on Virtual Server 2005 R2 for Commerce Server 2007. While setting it up, I only had access to the Internet via my wireless adapter. Consequently, I had to do the following in order to get the virtual machine to connect to the Internet:
  Install the Virtual Machine Additions.
  On the host machine, go to &amp;ldquo;Add Hardware&amp;rdquo; in Control Panel.</description>
