    <p>As was <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,1904b877-d1d4-4841-87d2-8b4ecd826965.aspx">announced yesterday</a>, Service Pack 1 has been released for Commerce Server 2007. This service pack includes support for Windows Vista, the ability to create <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/asp.net/aa336618.aspx">web application projects in Visual Studio 2005</a>, performance and security enhancements, and a slew of bug fixes.</p>
<p>I have detailed the process for installing SP1 and upgrading your CS sites in the following posts: <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,3e9bb1c9-4c0f-4468-af92-68ecf4db73d7.aspx">Commerce Server 2007 Service Pack 1 (SP1) Walkthrough</a> and <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,d4fe3f01-c318-4958-b46b-4e2a4b8827c0.aspx">Commerce Server 2007 Upgrade Wizard (post SP1 install) Walkthrough</a>.</p>
<p>While installing SP1 I encountered a rather strange problem. Let me try to explain how the problem occurred, and what I did to resolve it.</p>
<p>To begin, I decided to upgrade my Commerce Server 2007 virtual machine to SP1. To begin, I did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Followed the steps I detail in my post <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,3e9bb1c9-4c0f-4468-af92-68ecf4db73d7.aspx">Commerce Server 2007 Service Pack 1 (SP1) Walkthrough</a>. In fact, these screen shots were taken during this initial installation of SP1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After I installed SP1, I immediately launched the Upgrade Wizard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the most part, I followed the steps outlined in my post <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,d4fe3f01-c318-4958-b46b-4e2a4b8827c0.aspx">Commerce Server 2007 Upgrade Wizard (post SP1 install) Walkthrough</a>. However, instead of upgrading both my StarterSite and CSharpSite, I only upgraded my CSharpSite and then rebooted my machine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Why did I reboot the machine after only upgrading one site? Well, I&rsquo;m not exactly sure. Part of me wanted to see what would happen with only one site upgraded, and another part wanted to upgrade one site at a time while rebooting in-between. Regardless, I rebooted after installing only the CSharpSite.</p>
<p>After rebooting, here was my first indication that something was wrong.</p>
<p><img src="https://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/IssueswithCommerceServer2007SP1Installat_A115/Error_1.gif" alt="At least one service or driver failed during system startup."></p>
<p>So, I immediately went to the Event Viewer. I saw a number of errors involving the SQLSERVERAGENT, Commerce Server, and ENTSSO. Here&rsquo;s a look at the various errors in the log (the reboot occurred around 10:52 am &hellip; some of these other errors were thrown from my playing around before I resolved the problem):</p>
<p><img src="https://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/IssueswithCommerceServer2007SP1Installat_A115/Errors_1.gif" alt="Event Viewer errors"></p>
<p>I should note that the system was previously very healthy, as I use this VM all the time while writing the book <em><a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,96042b54-9859-4ea8-8497-5dab8033f405.aspx">Professional Commerce Server 2007</a></em> for WROX. In fact, I had been using the computer with no problems immediately before installing the service pack.</p>
<p>So, at this point it was clear that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The SQL Server Agent was no longer able to start-up.</p>
<p>SQLServerAgent could not be started (reason: Unable to connect to server &lsquo;(local)'; SQLServerAgent cannot start).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enterprise Single-Sign On (ENTSSO) was also having issues starting because it couldn&rsquo;t communicate to SQL Server 2005.</p>
<p>The SSO service failed to start.</p>
<p>Error Code: 0x800710D9, Unable to read from or write to the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commerce Server was complaining that I hadn&rsquo;t updated the StarterSite yet (this one is to be expected, as I hadn&rsquo;t updated it yet):</p>
<pre><code> Error in Commerce Administration Object : Description - 'The following resources are old. They will not function correctly until they are upgraded:  
 Product Catalog (7.1.0)  
 Marketing (7.0.0)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, something here is wrong, and SQL Server seemed to be at the heart of it.</p>
<p>The next thing I did was try to connect to SQL Server 2005. Using the SQL Server Management Studio, I tried to login with my Windows credentials. I wasn&rsquo;t surprised to see that I couldn&rsquo;t:</p>
<p><img src="https://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/IssueswithCommerceServer2007SP1Installat_A115/SQLError_1.gif" alt="A connection was successfully established to the server, but then an error occured during the pre-login handshake. (provider: Shared Memory Provider, error: 0 - No process is on the other end of the pipe.) (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 223)"></p>
<pre><code>A connection was successfully established to the server, but then an error occurred during the pre-login handshake. (provider: Shared Memory Provider, error: 0 - No process is on the other end of the pipe.) (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 223)&quot; (copied directly from dialog window)
</code></pre>
<p>I have never seen this error before, but wasn&rsquo;t surprised to see that I couldn&rsquo;t find anything anything on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-us%3AIE-SearchBox&amp;rlz=1I7GGIG&amp;q=%22A+connection+was+successfully+established+to+the+server%2C+but+then+an+error+occurred+during+the+pre-login+handshake.+%28provider%3A+Shared+Memory+Provider%2C+error%3A+0+-+No+process+is+on+the+other+end+of+the+pipe.%29+%28Microsoft+SQL+Server%2C+Error%3A+223%29%22">Google</a> or <a href="http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=%22A+connection+was+successfully+established+to+the+server%2C+but+then+an+error+occurred+during+the+pre-login+handshake.+%28provider%3A+Shared+Memory+Provider%2C+error%3A+0+-+No+process+is+on+the+other+end+of+the+pipe.%29+%28Microsoft+SQL+Server%2C+Error%3A+223%29%22&amp;form=QBNO">Live</a> (although, hopefully this post will come up in the future). Sure, various iterations of the first part can be found, but nothing seems applicable to this situation.</p>
<p>So, I decide to poke around. What bothered me was that SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) was running yet I couldn&rsquo;t connect to it, and the SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER) itself couldn&rsquo;t start. Even my attempts to manually start the service failed. Here&rsquo;s a look at SQL Server Configuration Manager:</p>
<p><img src="https://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/IssueswithCommerceServer2007SP1Installat_A115/Config_1.gif" alt="SQL Server Configuration Manager"></p>
<p>Also, I attempted to connect to Commerce Server by running the Upgrade Wizard &hellip; it didn&rsquo;t start, nor did I receive an error. It simply didn&rsquo;t start.</p>
<p>For some reason, one thing jumped out at me &ndash; I was running as LocalSystem rather than NT AUTHORITYNetworkService. Could this have something to do with it?</p>
<p>Not having any other ideas, I changed both SQL Server and SQL Server Agent to &ldquo;Log on as&rdquo; the &ldquo;Network Service&rdquo; (NT AUTHORITYNetworkService) instead of the LocalSystem account. I then restarted SQL Server 2005 and the SQL Server Agent. Lo and behold, the SQL Server Agent started-up!</p>
<p><img src="https://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/IssueswithCommerceServer2007SP1Installat_A115/Config2_1.gif" alt="Config2"></p>
<p>A little baffled, but encouraged that I was on track to resolving the problem (even if I don&rsquo;t understand the root cause), I tried to connect to SQL Server 2005. Sure enough, I was able to login to the database server and interact with the various databases. I also attempted to connect to the Commerce Server 2007 Upgrade Wizard, which immediat
ely started with no problems.</p>
<p>Since I wasn&rsquo;t too confident with the state of the computer (given that some services still weren&rsquo;t started), I decided to restart the computer. It restarted without a single error, and I was able to run the Upgrade Wizard successfully to upgrade the StarterSite.</p>
<p>At this point I don&rsquo;t quite know why there was a problem with the LocalSystem account after I installed SP1 for Commerce Server 2007. I intend to do a little more research to look into it.</p>
<p>Have any of you encountered this problem? Can you shed some light on the situation?</p>
<p>Thanks, and I hope this helps!</p>
