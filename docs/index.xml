      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve sat down and written a blog post. I&amp;rsquo;m humbled to say it took me a few hours to relearn Hugo and get it functioning on my PC. But this post isn&amp;rsquo;t about Hugo, migrating from GitHub Pages to Netlify, nor my decision to archive 12 years of old blog posts.
This blog post is to say, well, I have things I want to say.</description>

      <description>I never thought I’d be writing this blog post, yet here I am. After an incredible five years at Salesforce, it’s time to say “Mahalo a Aloha,” or thank you and goodbye.
I have so much gratitude for my colleagues at Salesforce, our customers, and of course, the fantastic Salesforce community. Never in my career have I felt the sense of mission that I have at Salesforce. The desire to advance the “state-of-the-art” for Salesforce developers was a passion reciprocated by my colleagues, supported by leadership, and always appreciated by our customers.</description>

      <description>I have been lucky to have so many amazing opportunities throughout my career, working with some of the smartest engineers and technologists in the world and filling various roles from software developer to architect to technology evangelist.
I first started programming in middle school by writing Pascal-based scripts for VT220 telnet clients that automatically played (and leveled) characters in MUDs. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on increasingly more complex solutions (if not as fun) including large-scale commerce implementations, low-latency distributed messaging systems, and cloud-based Monte Carlo simulations.</description>
