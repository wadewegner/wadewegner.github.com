<p><em><figcaption>Playing &ldquo;bump&rdquo; with my son and wife during the week.</figcaption></em></p>
<p>I think this past week marked a turning point for my training. The last few months have brought challenges that were new for me, and consequently I struggled with recovery and rest. I&rsquo;ve been able to debug and resolve most of those issues, and as a result feel as if I&rsquo;m headed in the right direction.</p>
<p>As this is my first &ldquo;Week-In-Review&rdquo; post, I&rsquo;ll share a few things to set some context:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been training several months for the Chuckanut 50k on 18, 2023. This is one of my favorite races. Shortly after this race I&rsquo;ll transition towards a 50 mile run in August.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m following the <a href="https://trainright.com/membership/training-plans/running/">CTS 50K Ultramarathon Training Plan - Advanced (20 weeks)</a>. I&rsquo;ve used the Intermediate plan twice before. It&rsquo;s my first time following advanced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The training is broken up into different training blocks (each are four weeks long) and get more specific as I get closer to the event. The blocks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>VO2 Max - high intensity, low volume</li>
<li>Lactate Threshold - develop and improve lactate threshold</li>
<li>Steady State - build a stronger aerobic engine and increase volume</li>
<li>Endurance/Steady State - train for specific event demands; highest volume, lowest intensity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Between each training block is a recovery week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are 10 more weeks until race day!</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="summary" class="anchor-link"><a href="#summary">Summary</a></h4>
<p>This week, I wrapped up the Steady State block. I won&rsquo;t lie, it was tough. State state workouts generally involve three intervals run for 10 minutes at an RPE of 8-9. This means that I&rsquo;m running HARD for 10 minutes. Making this harder, we had a lot of snow in December, and the majority of my runs ended up on the treadmill (which I love but also hate). I do much better with hard runs when I&rsquo;m outside on a trail.</p>
<p><strong>Run Duration</strong>: 7:04 | 7:55 (h:m)<br/>
<strong>Total TSS</strong>: 561 | 580
<strong>Total Distance</strong>: 41.4 mi</p>
<p>I was a little short of goals this week. But it&rsquo;s okay.</p>

<h5 id="monday" class="anchor-link"><a href="#monday">Monday</a></h5>
<p><strong>Rest</strong></p>
<p>I enjoyed the rest. I ran a 25k at Deception Pass State Park the previous Saturday and a recovery run on Sunday at Lord Hill. A day off the feet was appreciated.</p>

<h5 id="tuesday" class="anchor-link"><a href="#tuesday">Tuesday</a></h5>
<p><strong>Tempo Run 3x10min</strong></p>
<p>I ran a 7.79mi loop around my house that took me into the Redmond Watershed. This was the first time I&rsquo;d been on the trails around my house in a long time, and it felt glorious. It was also fun seeing some minor changes here and there (e.g. new gravel path).</p>
<p><img src="tuesday-run-map.png" alt="Map of Tuesday&amp;rsquo;s run"></p>
<p><strong>RPE</strong>: 8 | 8-9<br/>
<strong>Felt</strong>: Normal<br/>
<strong>Time</strong>: 1:22:32 | 1:20:00 (h:m:s)<br/>
<strong>Distance</strong>: 7.79 (mi)<br/>
<strong>Average pace</strong>: 10:36 (min/mi)<br/>
<strong>Elevation</strong>: 482 (ft)<br/>
<strong>TSS</strong>: 110 | 110<br/>
<strong>IF</strong>: 0.85 | 0.91<br/></p>

<h5 id="wednesday" class="anchor-link"><a href="#wednesday">Wednesday</a></h5>
<p><strong>Recovery Run 45 min</strong></p>
<p>I just wasn&rsquo;t feeling it on Wednesday. After a lovely time running on trails the day before, the treadmill felt like punishment. I cut this a bit short, but did return later in the evening and did a ~32 minute hike on the treadmill.</p>
<p><strong>RPE</strong>: 3<br/>
<strong>Felt</strong>: Somewhat Weak<br/>
<strong>Time</strong>: 0:30:08 | 0:45:00 (h:m:s)<br/>
<strong>Distance</strong>: 2.17 (mi)<br/>
<strong>Average pace</strong>: 13:55 (min/mi)<br/>
<strong>Elevation</strong>: 0 (ft)<br/>
<strong>TSS</strong>: 22 | 24<br/>
<strong>IF</strong>: 0.64 | 0.77<br/></p>

<h5 id="thursday" class="anchor-link"><a href="#thursday">Thursday</a></h5>
<p><strong>Tempo Run 3x10min</strong></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually remember why, but I ran on the treadmill again. Must have been weather related, but it escapes me. I reported feeling normal, but looking at the data you can tell I didn&rsquo;t really push it as hard as I should have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p><strong>RPE</strong>: 7 | 8-9<br/>
<strong>Felt</strong>: Normal<br/>
<strong>Time</strong>: 1:06:22 | 1:20:00 (h:m:s)<br/>
<strong>Distance</strong>: 6.37 (mi)<br/>
<strong>Average pace</strong>: 10:25 (min/mi)<br/>
<strong>Elevation</strong>: 0 (ft)<br/>
<strong>TSS</strong>: 89 | 110<br/>
<strong>IF</strong>: 0.85 | 0.91<br/></p>

<h5 id="friday" class="anchor-link"><a href="#friday">Friday</a></h5>
<p><strong>Easy Hike</strong></p>
<p>My training plan has Friday&rsquo;s as a rest day, but I felt pretty good and decided to do a hike on the treadmill. It&rsquo;s pretty nice to walk and watch Netflix.</p>
<p><strong>RPE</strong>: 3<br/>
<strong>Felt</strong>: Normal<br/>
<strong>Time</strong>: 0:41:54 (h:m:s)<br/>
<strong>Distance</strong>: 1.94 (mi)<br/>
<strong>Average pace</strong>: 21:36 (min/mi)<br/>
<strong>Elevation</strong>: 0 (ft)<br/>
<strong>TSS</strong>: 29<br/>
<strong>IF</strong>: 0.62<br/></p>

<h5 id="saturday" class="anchor-link"><a href="#saturday">Saturday</a></h5>
<p><strong>Endurance Run 2 Hours</strong></p>
<p>For me, one of the best things is to run with my son. He joined me for this workout. He&rsquo;s still building up again in preparation for a race we&rsquo;re doing in Febuary, so we went a bit slower than normal. (He&rsquo;s typically faster than me.) Consequently, the intensity was a bit less than I had hoped, but it was still a lovely run.</p>
<p>It was chilly and rainy outside. I got a new jacket recently that&rsquo;s water proof; problem is, I sweat so much that I get as wet on the inside as I am on the outside.</p>
<p><img src="saturday-run-map.png" alt="Map of Saturday&amp;rsquo;s run"></p>
<p><strong>RPE</strong>: <br/>
<strong>Felt</strong>: <br/>
<strong>Time</strong>: 1:47:25 | 2:00:00 (h:m:s)<br/>
<strong>Distance</strong>: 9.19 (mi)<br/>
<strong>Average pace</strong>: 11:41 (min/mi)<br/>
<strong>Elevation</strong>: 381 (ft)<br/>
<strong>TSS</strong>: 118 | 140<br/>
<strong>IF</strong>: 0.76 | 0.84<br/></p>

<h4 id="sunday" class="anchor-link"><a href="#sunday">Sunday</a></h4>
<p><strong>Endurance Run 2.5 Hours</strong></p>
<p>It was another cold and wet day in the Pacific Northwest! But as they say, there&rsquo;s no such thing as bad weather, just bad gear! And I love it!</p>
<p>Back-to-back long runs are key to my training strategy. Today felt great! In fact, I felt better today than I did the day before. I had a solid night of sleep and a lot of rest after the run yesterday, so I&rsquo;m sure that helped!</p>
<p><img src="sunday-run-map.png" alt="Map of Sunday&amp;rsquo;s run"></p>
<p><strong>RPE</strong>: <br/>
<strong>Felt</strong>: <br/>
<strong>Time</strong>: 2:17:57 | 2:30:00 (h:m:s)<br/>
<strong>Distance</strong>: 12.3 (mi)<br/>
<strong>Average pace</strong>: 11:12 (min/mi)<br/>
<strong>Elevation</strong>: 807 (ft)<br/>
<strong>TSS</strong>: 165 | 175<br/>
<strong>IF</strong>: 0.80| 0.84<br/></p>
<p>All-in-all, a great week of training!</p>
<p>Next week is all about recovery, so it&rsquo;ll be nice and easy. I&rsquo;m also planning to figure out how to start incorporating some strength training into my regular routine.</p>
