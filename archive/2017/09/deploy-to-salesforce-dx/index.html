    <p>If you&rsquo;re a Salesforce developer, it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ve heard us talk about <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/platform/dx">Salesforce DX</a> these past months. (If not, you&rsquo;re missing out and you should checkout the <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_intro.htm">official documentation</a>.) Since TrailheaDX, everyone has been able to use the new tools and services we&rsquo;ve made available as part of the Salesforce DX beta. Personally, I&rsquo;ve thoroughly enjoyed building all kinds of plugins for the Salesforce CLI.</p>
<ul>
<li>My primary plugin with lots of functionality: <a href="https://github.com/wadewegner/sfdx-waw-plugin">https://github.com/wadewegner/sfdx-waw-plugin</a></li>
<li>Generate code snippets from templates: <a href="https://github.com/wadewegner/sfdx-code-gen">https://github.com/wadewegner/sfdx-code-gen</a></li>
<li>Convert WSDL to Apex: <a href="https://github.com/wadewegner/sfdx-wsdl2apex-plugin0">https://github.com/wadewegner/sfdx-wsdl2apex-plugin</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One of our top goals has been to make deployment incredibly easy. With the Salesforce CLI, deploying your source is as easy as typing <code>sfdx force:source:push</code> and, within a few moments, your Scratch Org is refreshed with the latest source. This has proved immensely popular with developers looking for better development experiences.</p>
<p>Yet, during the beta, we&rsquo;ve seen a number of use cases for providing the ability to deploy source into a Scratch Org directly from a source control repository like Github:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You want to quickly try out the latest and greatest from a <a href="https://twitter.com/ccoenraets">Christophe Coenraets</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/muenzpraeger">René Winkelmeyer</a> blog post. (You know you do!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re not able to access a machine where you can install the Salesforce CLI. (Maybe you&rsquo;re at a conference?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laziness. (It&rsquo;s okay, it happens to me too.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless of the reasons, a few of us agree and thought it worth doing something about it.</p>
<p>Without further ado, I&rsquo;m <strong>pleased to introduce <a href="https://deploy-to-sfdx.com">Deploy to Salesforce DX</a></strong>, an open-source and community-driven tool for automating Salesforce DX deployments from public repositories to Scratch Orgs.</p>

<h2 id="background" class="anchor-link"><a href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<p>I started working on this tool a couple months ago. When I began, there were a few blocking issues that prevented it from working. Many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/amphro">Thomas Dvornik</a>, one of the lead engineers on the Salesforce CLI team, who added the ability to use access tokens minted from a separate Web Server OAuth flow to authenticate to the Dev Hub. (More on this in a future blog post, as it&rsquo;s an incredibly useful feature.)</p>
<p>Additionally, the first few iterations of this tool significantly lacked polish and simplicity. Without the amazing UX design and development work of <a href="https://twitter.com/benjisnyder">Ben Snyder</a> this tool would be an ugly mess.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, I&rsquo;m grateful for the contribution from <a href="https://twitter.com/andyinthecloud">Andrew Fawcett</a>. As the official owner of the &ldquo;Deploy to Salesforce&rdquo; button, it pleases me that he found it worthwhile to contribute some useful code to this project, and I&rsquo;m hopeful that he (and others) continue to contribute.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the end game for <strong>Deploy to Salesforce DX</strong>?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question. I&rsquo;m as curious as you. This started off as a project to see if it was possible. I had numerous questions. Can this run on Heroku? <em>(Yes, in fact it can, powered by the <a href="https://github.com/wadewegner/salesforce-cli-buildpack">salesforce-cli-buildpack</a>; more on this in another post!)</em> Can we orchestrate a Salesforce DX deployment in one click? <em>(Yes, look at the .salesforcedx.yaml file to see the instructions.)</em> How hard is it to invoke the CLI itself from code? <em>(Turns out, it&rsquo;s not too bad!)</em> Ultimately, my goal with <strong>Deploy to Salesforce DX</strong> is to show what&rsquo;s possible. If it serves nothing more than to let people know all the crazy/awesome things you can do with Salesforce DX, I&rsquo;ll consider it a success.</p>
<p>I have fully open-source this application, so you can see how it works. Andy and I have already started putting together a set of feature requirements, so feel free to <a href="https://github.com/wadewegner/deploy-to-sfdx/issues">contribute your own</a>. I&rsquo;d also love it if you contributed, so feel free to fork and send me a pull request.</p>

<h2 id="try-it-out" class="anchor-link"><a href="#try-it-out">Try it out</a></h2>
<p>The website itself explains how to get started, to head on over to <a href="https://deploy-to-sfdx.com/">https://deploy-to-sfdx.com/</a>. There are also a few Github repositories out there that already support the tool:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-dreamhouse">https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-dreamhouse</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-simple">https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-simple</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ccoenraets/northern-trail">https://github.com/ccoenraets/northern-trail</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/muenzpraeger/salesforce-einstein-platform-apex">https://github.com/muenzpraeger/salesforce-einstein-platform-apex</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Want to add this to your own Github repository? Please do! It&rsquo;s as easy as adding the following tag to your repositories repo:</p>
<pre><code>[![Deploy](https://deploy-to-sfdx.com/dist/assets/images/DeployToSFDX.svg)](https://deploy-to-sfdx.com/)
</code></pre><p>That will give you a lovely button that users can click on to deploy your source directly into one of their Scratch Orgs.</p>
<p><img src="https://deploy-to-sfdx.com/dist/assets/images/DeployToSFDX.svg" alt="Deploy" title="Deploy"></p>
<p>If you want to further customize your deployment, you can add a <code>.salesforcedx.yaml</code> file in your repo. It&rsquo;ll look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>scratch-org-def: config/project-scratch-def.json
assign-permset: false
run-apex-tests: true
delete-scratch-org: false
show-scratch-org-url: true
</code></pre><p>This instructs the service to perform additional or custom activities. Definitely useful if you&rsquo;ve got a Lightning app or you want to run a set of tests.</p>

<h2 id="word-of-warning" class="anchor-link"><a href="#word-of-warning">Word of warning</a></h2>
<p>Before I close, I want to remind everyone that this is not an official Salesforce service or tool. While I am a Salesforce employee, I&rsquo;ve built this service on the side. I don&rsquo;t offer any official support, although I will do my very best to <a href="https://github.com/wadewegner/deploy-to-sfdx/issues">respond to issues</a>. Since the tool only interacts with Scratch Orgs, the risk is minimal. That said, consider yourself warned.</p>
<p>I hope you find this tool useful. It was a lot of fun to build. Thanks again to all the individuals who helped along the way!</p>
