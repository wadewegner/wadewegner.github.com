The important take away is that in this HOL you will take an application through the full provisioning process. This is extremely valuable if you have customers/partners looking to publish their applications into the Windows Azure Marketplace for Applications.

 

**_Hands-On Lab Details_**

 

There are five exercises in the HOL:

 

  
  * **Exercise 0**: Understanding a SaaS Subscription Scenario
   
  * **Exercise 1**: Modify your Application to support Windows Azure Marketplace Subscriptions
   
  * **Exercise 2**: Register the Application in Windows Azure Marketplace and Test Subscriptions with the Dev Playground
   
  * **Exercise 3**: Add Support for Unsubscribe messages
   
  * **Exercise 4**: Learn how to Publish in Windows Azure Marketplace, Explore the Finished App
