I have recently been scouring MSFT resources for information related to architecture and the role of enterprise architects, and I have found two resources that I wanted to highlight:




[**MSDN Architecture Center**](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/default.aspx)




This is a great central hub for architectural information related to MSFT technologies, platforms, and products. There are also a number of excellent architects that deal with topics such as [service oriented architecture (SOA)](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/aa948857.aspx), [Software + Services (S+S, SaaS)](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/aa699384.aspx), [security](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/aa973363.aspx), [enterprise architecture](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb469938.aspx), [agile development](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb404166.aspx), and more. Additionally, it is tied into a number of great blog feeds by various architects in the MSFT community.




[**The Microsoft Architecture Journal**](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/arcjournal/default.aspx)




As an example, Journal 13 is focused on Software + Services (S+S). As such, topics include: [The Internet Service Bus](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/bb906065.aspx), [Project Astoria](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/bb906063.aspx), [Implications of Software + Services Consumption for Enterprise IT](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/bb906061.aspx), [Enterprise Mashups](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/bb906060.aspx), [Microsoft Office as a Platform for Software + Services](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/bb906062.aspx), and [A Planet Ruled by Software Architectures](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/bb906059.aspx). Additionally, it features profiles, such as the profile on [Ray Ozzie](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/bb906064.aspx) this month.




And the best part of it is that, after you register, you can get a [free subscription to the MSFT architecture journal](https://www.msarchitecturejournal.com/Default.aspx).




You can also subscribe to the [RSS feed](http://msdn.microsoft.com/arcjournal/rss/rss.xml). Good stuff!




As a side note, I'll admit that I need to find more resources like this that are not MSFT specific. While I believe MSFT does a great job of addressing architectural issues that are agnostic of platform and technology, I need to continue to diversify the helpings on my plate!




If any one has suggestions, please send them my way!
