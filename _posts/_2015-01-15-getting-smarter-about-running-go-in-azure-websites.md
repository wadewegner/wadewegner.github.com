The fun part about blogging while learning something new is everyone gets to see how your understanding evolves over time. As I continue to learn the Go language I continuously refine and refactor the ways with which I approach problems. For example, as I've learned more about the Go language, I've changed my approach to running and deploying Go in Azure Websites.

In this post I want to share some of the work I've done to make running Go in Azure Websites not only faster but also easier to deploy. If you want to jump directly to the functioning bits and get started, take a look at my [azure-website-go-builder](https://github.com/wadewegner/azure-website-go-builder) Github repository. Below you'll find a detailed exploration of how the solution works.
