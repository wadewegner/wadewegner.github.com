I started blogging as a way of archiving tips-and-tricks I learn everyday so that I can go refer back to the post rather than having to constantly re-learn everything. I have also tried to document ways I have solved various problems and issues that I am confronted with while working with various technologies. I'll admit that, originally, this blog was a purely selfish endeavor - I wasn't motivated by any altruistic reasons, I simply wanted to have a way to archive things I've learned so that I could refer back to them.




Recently, though, this has all changed. I didn't realize how much satisfaction I'd receive from seeing the that other people are also finding value in my posts. As readership has increased, and I get more and more feedback from people that found a solution to their problem in one of my posts, I have tried to post better and more useful content.

I know that 100 feed subscribers is a small milestone (many of the blogs I subscriber to have thousands of subscribers), but nonetheless I am proud of the slow, organic growth I've seen in my feed subscribers and blog visitors. I don't try anything gimmicky - all I do is post content based on thing things I do everyday and the things I learn along the way.




I just thought I'd share my feed stats with you. It's neat (at least, _I think it is_) to see the growth of subscribers since the day I started tracking them. Here are my FeedBurner stats:

At the same time, traffic to the blog itself has continued to grow. Here are stats from Google over the same period:

(Amazing how visits just plummet on the weekend!)




Thanks to all of you that subscribe to my blog or occasionally visit. And special thanks to those of you that e-mail me or leave a comment. For those of you that haven't contacted me one way or another, please drop me an e-mail or write a comment once in awhile. I would love to learn who you are and what you find valuable about my blog.




Thanks!
