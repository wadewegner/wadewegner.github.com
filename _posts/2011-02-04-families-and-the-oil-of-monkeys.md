_Pardon the indulgence, but this post is not related to Windows Azure, cloud computing, or technology whatsoever. Instead, it’s a celebration of my wonderful family, and the fun we have._![](http://www.potstuck.com/content/2008/01/the-3-monkeys.jpg)

 

It all started one morning with a simple email from my sister. It degraded into a war of “poetry” that, to this day, is still unresolved. It’s become one of those things that we never talk about in person, but is resurrected over email by my mother.

When I read this, I knew my sister was baiting me … I couldn’t resist!

It took awhile, but my sister finally responded with a slightly weak …

I immediately knew that something needed to be done to pull this back into the realm of nonsense, so without missing a beat, I took action! What happened throughout the rest of the day will live forever in legend!

This seemed to get them going (or else my dad finally got out of bed) because I got my first good rebuttal.

Alright. Bring it, old man.

Nailed it. I was pretty sure he was weeping with shame at this point. Alas, he struck back!

Utter brilliance, if you ask me.

To continue - just would not be cool.

Yes, a duel it is. En Garde!

I thought a truce was pretty kind of me, considering I clearly won. After all, he is my dad.

For whenever you do

Not too bad. The old man has some spirit.

Another “helpful” message from my sister. However, it had the desired effect, and I finished strong.

As I said, these duels occasionally continue today. It’s a good time.

 

I wanted to find a way to more “permanently” record these fun messages, so again, pardon the personal indulgence. I hope you’ve found some humor in it.

 

Do you and your families have similar crazy riffs like this?
