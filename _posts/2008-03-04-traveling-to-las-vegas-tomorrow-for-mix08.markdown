![](http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/Mix08.jpg)I'll be in Las Vegas again tomorrow to attend MIX08. In it's third year, MIX is an opportunity to learn about Microsoft's strategy surrounding the future of the web, the latest Microsoft web technologies, rich user experiences, and Vista and IE8 forecasts. It's a great event for technical strategists, creative designers, and technical decision makers. This year, MIX will explore the following:






  * High-fidelity commerce, content, media, services and security

  * How new technologies can help find, retain and up-sell customers

  * The latest on Silverlight, Internet Explorer, ASP.NET, Expression, Windows Live and other key technologies through keynotes, presentations, discussions, and labs 



Keynote presentations will be presented by Steve Ballmer, Guy Kawasaki, and Scott Guthrie.




Here are the tracks I'll be attending:
