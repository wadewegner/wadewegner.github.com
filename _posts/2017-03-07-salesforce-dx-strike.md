Like many people at Salesforce and in the community, I was really excited and impressed to see [Lightning Strike by Appiphany](http://www.lightningstrike.io/). Not to take away from the remarkable tool they built to visually explore and configure Lightning components, I was most excited by the custom Lightning Components they built and released to the community through their [Github repository Strike-Components](https://github.com/appiphony/Strike-Components).

Immediately I wanted to try these components out myself. And fortunate, using Salesforce DX, it's really quite easy.

Here's a Gist showing the commands I ran to quickly pull these open-sourced Lightning components into my Salesforce DX workspace and push into my scratch org.

I think this is a great example of how Salesforce developers can quickly take advantage of open-sourced software.

In fact, this has me thinking that there's more we can do as part of Salesforce DX to make this even easier. Stay tuned for more updates!
