We just released a [Salesforce1 tutorial on Github](https://github.com/developerforce/demo-df13-devkeynote-s1app) that walks you though the same demo presented by [Dave Carroll](http://twitter.com/dcarroll) at the [Dreamforce '13 Developer's Keynote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KELBWQIVcfk&feature=share&list=PLScnZWsj0lrRCMuciE0La1_iKtCPt4Kka) and enables you to build a [Salesforce1 application](http://www.salesforce.com/salesforce1/).

Using this tutorial, you will:

* Use the [Force Command-Line Interface (CLI)](http://github.com/heroku/force) tool to manipulate metadata in Salesforce.
* Create a **Salesforce1 mobile application** using the Salesforce1 app container.
* Create **Visualforce components and pages** enabled for the Salesforce1 mobile application.
* Use **mobile cards** and create **publisher actions**.
* Create a **compact view** for the page layout that is better designed for the Salesforce1 mobile application.

This tutorial is open-sourced on Github. Feel free to grab the code and run through the tutorial.

The tutorial provides the following resources to make it as easy as possible for you to try it out yourself:

1) A set of scripts to populate the demo schema and data into your Salesforce organization.
2) A detailed [setup guide](https://github.com/developerforce/demo-df13-devkeynote-s1app/blob/master/SETUP.md) to get you ready.
3) A [step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/developerforce/demo-df13-devkeynote-s1app/blob/master/DEMO.md) that walks you through the entire process.
