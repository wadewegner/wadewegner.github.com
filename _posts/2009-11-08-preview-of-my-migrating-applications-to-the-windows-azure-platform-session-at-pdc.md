It’s hard to believe that the [Professional Developers Conference (PDC) 2009](http://microsoftpdc.com/) is less than two weeks away. It doesn’t seem that long ago that I sat behind the stage at PDC 2008 providing support for the [RedPrairie keynote with Bob Muglia](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/KYN01/) and spoke in a breakout session with [Jack Greenfield on Multi-Enterprise Business Applications](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/BB59/). I’ll be back again this year, and I’m giving another talk – this time on [lessons learned when migrating applications to the Windows Azure platform](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/SVC22).

 

Rather than present this session entirely on my own, I decided to invite some of my customers to come and talk about their own experiences. I am extremely excited that the following three customers will join me at PDC:

 

![CCH](https://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/2009/11/CCH.png)

[CCH, a Wolters Kluwer Company](http://www.cch.com/) - CCH is a Wolters Kluwer company, based in Riverwoods, Illinois, providing tax and business law information and software solutions. The company has approximately 700 products for the United States market.

 

![accenture-logo](https://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/2009/11/accenturelogo2.png)

[Accenture](http://www.accenture.com/) - Launched originally as the business and technology consulting arm of Arthur Andersen, Accenture is now among the world’s largest consulting organizations. It employs more than 180,000 people in 52 countries.

 

[Domino’s Pizza](https://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/2009/11/Dominos1.png) – See how Domino’s Pizza is running Java and Tomcat in Windows Azure to run their eCommerce application. Windows Azure provides high scalability to handle Super Bowl load, interoperability with different platforms and technologies, and the ability to integrate to on-premises resources. 

 

Our intent with this talk is to make it highly interactive – translation: **ask us questions**! We have a lot of information to share with you, and while we like to present, we’d much rather engage in a meaningful conversation. Thus, we plan to quickly provide the following information for each of the solutions migrated:

 

  
  1. Background on the application (i.e. what does it do? who uses it? what technology stack?). 
   
  2. The previous architecture (before the migration to Windows Azure) and some of the challenges this architecture presented. 
   
  3. The new architecture leveraging the Windows Azure platform. 
   
  4. The migration process: what was easy, what was hard, what worked, and what didn’t. 
 

After providing these details, we want to open the session up for Q&A.

 

We know that we won’t answer all of your questions in the time allotted to us, so we plan to stick around after the presentation so that we can talk to you 1-on-1 and answer your questions.

 

It’s going to be a great PDC – I hope you’re there! If so, be sure and come to our presentation on [Lessons Learned: Migrating Applications to the Windows Azure Platform](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/SVC22).
