Having problems getting yourself or your team up to speed on Commerce Server? Want to leverage your existing skills in ASP.NET and SQL Server?

As many of you are probably aware, good technical training resources for Commerce Serve 2007 are hard to come by. In no way is this meant to be a criticism of the Commerce Server product team, as they have made every effort to blog and webcast about technical topics and some of the newer features of Commerce Server. Nevertheless, there's still a void with regards to technical training resources (a void I hope to fill with my book [_Professional Commerce Server 2007_](http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,96042b54-9859-4ea8-8497-5dab8033f405.aspx)).

One thing I've noticed during my conversations with companies building Commerce Server solutions is that most companies have internal technical resources with solid skills in ASP.NET, SQL Server 2000/2005, and even BizTalk 2006. Companies want to leverage their existing skills, and quickly acquire the specific Commerce Server skills required to implement and develop successful systems.

If this seems to accurately describe the situation you find youself in, please let me know at [wade.wegner@gmail.com](mailto:wade.wegner@gmail.com). If I don't have a resolution, perhaps I can find someone that does!
