I know this is old news, but this post is primarily a reminder to myself -- I keep forgetting! If you try to open a recently downloaded (or installed) help file (*.chm) in Vista, you will get the following message:




[![Navigation to the webpage was canceled](http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/ViewinghelpfilesinVista_6D9E/image1_thumb.png)](http://images.wadewegner.com/wordpress/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/ViewinghelpfilesinVista_6D9E/image1.png)




> 

> 
> Navigation to the webpage was canceled. Retype the address.




In order to view the help file, you have to right-click the file, choose Properties, and then click Unblock.

Thanks to [Bill Evjen's](http://geekswithblogs.net/evjen/) for the [reminder](http://geekswithblogs.net/evjen/archive/2006/06/29/83567.aspx).
