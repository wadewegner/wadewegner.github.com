I have started hosting this blog in a new location. Unfortunately there were some routing issues, and I think the blog was down for about two or three hours. Those problem has been corrected, and it shouldn't happen again (who would have guessed that the network adapter was defaulted to turn off when not being used).




Hey!  I'm a software developer, not a systems guru!
