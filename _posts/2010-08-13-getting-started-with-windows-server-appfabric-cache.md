I struggled today to find a good “Getting started with Windows Server AppFabric Cache” tutorial – either my _search fu _failed me or it simply doesn’t exist. Nevertheless, I was able to piece together the information I needed to get started.

I recommend you break this up into three steps:
  
* Installing Windows Server AppFabric

* Configuring Windows Server AppFabric Cache

* Testing Windows Server AppFabric Cache with Sample Apps
 
I think this article will serve as a good tutorial on getting started, and we can refer back to it as the basis for more advanced scenarios.

**Installing Windows Serve AppFabric**

1. Get the [Web Platform Installer](http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx). 

2. Once it is installed and opened, select **Options**.

3. Under **Display additional scenarios** select **Enterprise**.

4. Now you’ll see an Enterprise tab. Select it, and choose **Windows Server AppFabric**. Click **Install**. This will start a multi-step process for installing Windows Server AppFabric (which in my case required two reboots to complete).

**Configuring Windows Server AppFabric Cache**

1. Open the **Windows Server AppFabric Configuration Wizard** (Start –> Windows Server AppFabric –> Configure AppFabric). 

2. Click **Next** until you reach the **Caching Service** step. Check **Set Caching Service configuration**, select **SQL Server AppFabric Caching Service Configuration Store Provider** for the configuration provider, and click **Configure**.

3. Check **Create AppFabric Caching Service configuration database**, confirm the **Server **name, and specify a **Database** name. Click **OK**.

4. When asked if you want to continue, click **Yes**.

5. You will receive confirmation that your database was created and registered.

6. On the **Cache Node** step, confirm the selected port nodes.

7. You will be asked to continue and apply the configuration settings; select **Yes**.         

	![Continue](https://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/2010/08/image8.png)

8. On the last step you’ll click **Finish**. 

9. Open up an elevated **Windows PowerShell **window. 

10. Add the Distributed Cache administration module      
    
    	Import-Module DistributedCacheAdministration

11. Set the context of your Windows PowerShell session to the desired cache cluster with Use-CacheCluster. You can run this without parameters to use the connection parameters provided during configuration. 
    
	    Use-CacheCluster

12. Grant your user account access to the cache cluster as a client. Specify your user and domain name. 
    
		Grant-CacheAllowedClientAccount domainusername

13. Verify your user account has been granted access. 
	
		Get-CacheAllowedClientAccounts

14. Start the cluster. 

	    Start-CacheCluster

**Testing Windows Server AppFabric Cache with Sample Apps**

1. Grab a copy of the [Microsoft AppFabric Samples](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=167153), which are a series of _very_ short examples.

2. Extract the samples locally.

3. Open up **CacheSampleWebApp.sln** (..SamplesCacheCacheSampleWebApp).

4. Right-click the **CreateOrder.aspx** file and select **Set As Start Page**.

5. Hit **F5** to start the solution.

6. Confirm that the cache is functioning by creating a sample order, getting the sample order, and updating the sample order.

Once you accomplish these three steps, you’ll have the basis for building more complex caching solutions.

I hope this helps!
