The October 2011 update of the training kit includes the following updates: 

 

  
  * **[New Hands-On Lab]** SQL Azure Data-tier Applications 
   
  * **[New Hands-On Lab]** SQL Azure Data Sync 
   
  * **[New Hands-On Lab]** SQL Azure Federations

As with the September release, we have shipped an (updated) preview of our web installer. The training kit web installer is a very small application weighing in at 2MB. The web installer enables you to select and download just the hands-on labs, demos, and presentations that you want instead of downloading the entire training kit. As new or updated hands-on labs, presentations, and demos are available they will automatically show up in the web installer – so you won’t have to download it again.

We really try to make these training resources valuable to you, so please be sure to provide feedback if you find a bug, mistake, or feel as if we should including something else in the kit.
