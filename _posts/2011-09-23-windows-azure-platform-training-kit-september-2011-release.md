Yesterday we released the Window Azure Platform Training Kit – September 2011 Release. You can get the content here:

 

  
  * [Windows Azure Platform Training Kit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=130354) (offline)
   
  * [Windows Azure Platform Training Courses](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/gg271268) (online)
 

The September 2011 release of the training kit includes the following updates: 

 

  
  * **[New Hands-On Lab]** Service Bus Messaging
   
  * **[Updated]** Labs and Demos to leverage the new Window Azure SDK & Tools 1.5
   
  * **[Updated]** Labs and Demos to leverage the new Windows Azure AppFabric SDK 1.5
   
  * **[Updated]** Introduction to Windows Azure Marketplace for Data
   
  * Applied several minor fixes in content
 

The updates for the Windows Azure SDK & Tools 1.5 and the Windows Azure AppFabric SDK 1.5 are really quite significant – it takes a lot of work to pull this off. To give you an idea, take a look at everything we did:

 

  
  * **25 of the 30 hands-on labs **were updated to use the Windows Azure SDK 1.5 and/or Windows Azure AppFabric SDK 1.5.
   
  * **15 of the 25 demos** were updated to use the Windows Azure SDK 1.5 and/or Windows Azure AppFabric SDK 1.5.
   
  * Approximately **145 projects updated**.
   
  * **86 dependency checker files** updated for 25 hands-on labs and 18 demos.
   
  * **22 hands-on labs and 7 demos** updated for changes to the Windows Azure Portal experience.
 

We really try to make these training resources valuable to you, so please be sure to provide feedback if you find a bug, mistake, or feel as if we should including something else in the kit.
