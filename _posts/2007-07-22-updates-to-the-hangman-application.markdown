I had no idea that this game would be so popular! Despite the crappy graphics, it's been referred half a dozen times, and received almost 300 unique hits in the last 24-hours. Pretty amazing!




Here's the link to [Hangman](http://apps.wadewegner.com/hangman). Give it a try. Here's the [original Hangman announcement](http://www.wadewegner.com/2007/07/21/HangmanApplicationBuiltOnSilverlightAndNET35.aspx).




There have been a few updates to the original program, including:






  * Includes the definition of the word; calls a .NET web service that parses a web response from Dictionary.com (please let me know if you find problems!)

  * Tracks statistics (e.g. total times played, won, and lost); so far we lose a LOT more 

  * Frees the man from the noose if you win



Yes, they're all silly little updates, but hopefully it increases the enjoyment of the game.




Here are a couple screen shots with the updates. The first one shows what happens when you die, err, lose.

This next one shows what happens when you win. Doesn't that look a lot more pleasant?

This sure is fun stuff to play with. Now that I feel more comfortable with Silverlight and WPF, there are all kinds of things I'd like to write. It's a shame I'm not more artistic.




Anyone out there have some mad artistic skills that would like to team up with me?




Best of luck!
