I had the great pleasure of co-authoring an [article on application migration to Windows Azure](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff872379.aspx) for [MSDN Magazine](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/default.aspx) with my friend George Huey, creator of the [SQL Azure Migration Wizard](http://sqlazuremw.codeplex.com/).
