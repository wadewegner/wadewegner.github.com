In addition to building the [Composite Application keynote demo](http://player.microsoftpdc.com/Session/6f853fa2-06f6-45e5-ac25-18c31cc4ba32/9588.561) presented by [James Conard](http://www.jamesconard.com/) and Bob Muglia, I presented a session on the new [Windows Azure AppFabric Caching service](http://player.microsoftpdc.com/Session/1f607983-c6eb-4d9f-b644-55247e8adda6) that’s now available as a CTP release in the AppFabric [LABS environment](http://portal.appfabriclabs.com/). You can find the presentation here: [http://player.microsoftpdc.com/Session/1f607983-c6eb-4d9f-b644-55247e8adda6](http://player.microsoftpdc.com/Session/1f607983-c6eb-4d9f-b644-55247e8adda6)

A few interesting notes on the Caching service:

 

  
  * It’s a distributed, in-memory, application cache provided entirely as a service – no installation, management, or deployment required
   
  * Low latency and high throughput (i.e. it’s fast)
   
  * Based off of Windows Server AppFabric Caching (codename “Velocity”), and the development experience is identical
   
  * Local cache support allows you to keep your data in-memory on the client, reducing network latency penalties
   
  * You can cache any managed object, regardless of the size; if using local cache you pay no serialization costs
   
  * Secured by the Access Control service
   
  * Pre-built providers for ASP.NET session state and page output caching
 

You’re going to hear a lot about the Caching service from me, as it fills a very significant gap in the Windows Azure Platform.
