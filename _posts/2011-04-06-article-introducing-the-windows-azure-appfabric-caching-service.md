I was excited to receive my MSDN Magazine in the mail this week, as an article written by myself and [Karandeep Anand](http://www.linkedin.com/in/karandeep)—a Principal Group Program Manager on the AppFabric team—was finally published. These things generally take a month or so from the time you finish writing them, which is often challenging in a services world.

 

You can now read this article online: [Introducing the Windows Azure AppFabric Caching Service](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg983488.aspx)

Don’t let the title deceive you – it’s not your typical “Introducing…” or “Getting Started” tutorial. We wanted to delve deeper, and included:

 

  
  * Under the Hood
   
  * Architectural Guidance
   
  * Setup
   
  * Using Cache in Your App
   
  * What’s Next?
 

Karan and I are also giving a talk at MIX11 entitled [Build Fast Web Applications with Windows Azure AppFabric Caching](http://channel9.msdn.com/events/MIX/MIX11/SVC01) where we’ll not only build on foundational principals laid out in this article, but also show a lot of compelling demonstrations.

 

The best part is that you can start using the Caching service today as part of the Community Technology Preview (CTP). Sign up at: [https://portal.appfabriclabs.com/](https://portal.appfabriclabs.com/).
