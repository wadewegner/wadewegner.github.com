![Wade Wegner](https://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/2011/12/CloudCoverLive.png "Wade Wegner")

I consider myself extremely lucky to have had so many amazing opportunities throughout my career, working with some of the smartest engineers and technologists in the world, and filling various roles from software developer to architect to technology evangelist.

I first started programming in middle school by writing Pascal-based scripts for VT220 telnet clients that automatically played (and leveled) characters in [MUDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD). Since then I've worked on increasingly more complex solutions (if not as fun) including large-scale commerce implementations, low-latency distributed messaging systems, and cloud-based Monte Carlo simulations.

I currently work for Microsoft as a Program Manager on the [Microsoft Azure](http://www.azure.com) engineering team. If you care to know all the boring details of my career, please connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/wadewegner/).

Outside of work, I am an aspiring brew master. If you care to hear about my brewing (and tasting) adventures you can [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/wadewegner).
