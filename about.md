![Wade Wegner](https://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/2011/12/CloudCoverLive.png)

I have been lucky to have so many amazing opportunities throughout my career, working with some of the smartest engineers and technologists in the world and filling various roles from software developer to architect to technology evangelist.

I first started programming in middle school by writing Pascal-based scripts for VT220 telnet clients that automatically played (and leveled) characters in [MUDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD). Since then, I've worked on increasingly more complex solutions (if not as fun) including large-scale commerce implementations, low-latency distributed messaging systems, and cloud-based Monte Carlo simulations.

I work for Salesforce as a Product Manager on the Salesforce Lightning Platform. If you care to know all the boring details of my career, please connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/wadewegner/).

Outside of work, I am an aspiring brewmaster. If you care to hear about my brewing (and tasting) adventures you can [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/wadewegner).
