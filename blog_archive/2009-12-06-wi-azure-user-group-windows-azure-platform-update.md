Last week I presented at the [Wisconsin Azure User Group](http://www.azureusergroup.com/group/wi) for the second time, along with [Clark Sell](http://blogs.msdn.com/csell/). Our goal was to provide an overview of everything announced at the [Professional Developers Conference (PDC) 2009](http://microsoftpdc.com/). We made a ton of announcements, and I recommend you check out the [Microsoft PDC website](http://microsoftpdc.com/) for more information, including videos and decks from all the presentations.

> Shameless plug: watch my session on migrating applications to the Windows Azure platform with Accenture, CCH, Dominos, and Original Digital – [Lessons Learned: Migrating Applications to the Windows Azure Platform](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/SVC22).

 

While I was supposed to only spend twenty minutes talking about updates to the Windows Azure platform, I ended up spending over an hour. There was too much information to share; here’s a short outline:

 

  
  * Rebranding of the .NET Services as the Windows Azure platform AppFabric. 
   
  * [Microsoft Codename “Dallas”](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/dallas/), a content brokerage and discovery platform available as a CTP at commercial launch. 
   
  * Windows Azure platform integration with [Microsoft Pinpoint](http://www.pinpoint.microsoft.com/en-US/about.aspx). 
   
  * Enhanced service architectures (i.e. inner role communication, worker roles exposed outside the datacenter, etc.). 
   
  * [Enhanced diagnostics in Windows Azure](http://blogs.msdn.com/windowsazure/archive/2009/12/01/introducing-windows-azure-diagnostics.aspx).
   
  * Ability to use existing NTFS APIs to store data in durable drives in Windows Azure (called [Windows Azure XDrive](http://blogs.msdn.com/windowsazure/archive/2009/11/25/windows-azure-storage-at-pdc-2009.aspx)). 
   
  * Administrator privileges in the Windows Azure virtual machines. 
   
  * Deployment of pre-configured virtual machine images while still benefiting from the Windows Azure service model. 
   
  * User-selectable geo-[locations for replicas of Azure storage](http://blogs.msdn.com/windowsazure/archive/2009/11/25/windows-azure-storage-at-pdc-2009.aspx). 
   
  * Secondary indices on Windows Azure tables. 
   
  * [Content Delivery Network](http://blogs.msdn.com/windowsazure/archive/2009/11/25/windows-azure-storage-at-pdc-2009.aspx).
   
  * Remote terminal server access to virtual machines. 
   
  * Tool for data synchronization called [SQL Azure Data Sync](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/developers/sqlazure/datasync/), built on the Microsoft Synch Framework and ADO.NET Sync Services. 
   
  * Claims-based access control for REST web services through the Access Control Service. 
   
  * Commercial launch in and paid usage in February, 2010. 
   
  * Datacenter options in USA, Europe, and Asia. 
 

Thanks to everyone for their patience – especially Clark – as I went on, and on, and on …

 

Don’t forget that you can request and redeem tokens for the Commercial Technology Preview (CTP) at [http://windowsazure.com/](http://windowsazure.com/). This provides you free usages, with quotas, through February 1, 2010.

 

Here’s the deck I presented:

 

 

Thanks to everyone that attended – I had a great time!
