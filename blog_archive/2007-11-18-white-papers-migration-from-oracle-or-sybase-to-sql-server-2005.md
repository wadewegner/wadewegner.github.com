Just noticed these two gems (again from the [MSDN Architecture Center](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/default.aspx)):

[Guide to Migrating from Oracle to SQL Server 2005](http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/c/8/ec8d5025-7ef7-4dcc-a9f3-9c297cf5350e/SSMAOracle.docx)

Summary: "This white paper explores challenges that arise when you migrate from an Oracle 7.3 database or later to SQL Server 2005. It describes the implementation differences of database objects, SQL dialects, and procedural code between the two platforms. The entire migration process using SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle (SSMA Oracle) is explained in depth, with a special focus on converting database objects and PL/SQL code."

[Guide to Migrating from Sybase ASE to SQL Server 2005](http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/c/8/ec8d5025-7ef7-4dcc-a9f3-9c297cf5350e/SSMASybase.docx)

Summary: "This white paper covers known issues for migrating Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise database to SQL Server 2005. Instructions for handling the differences between the two platforms are included. The paper describes how SQL Server Migration Assistant, the best tool for this type of migration, can help resolve various migration issues." 

I definitely could have used these two documents a few months ago! 

I hope this helps!
