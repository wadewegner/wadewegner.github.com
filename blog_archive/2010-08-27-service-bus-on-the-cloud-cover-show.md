[Ryan Dunn](http://dunnry.com/blog/) and [Steve Marx](http://blog.smarx.com/) have a great show on Channel9 called the [Cloud Cover Show](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Cloud+Cover/). I’ve been watching it since the beginning, and have learned a lot about different features of the [Windows Azure Platform](http://www.azure.com/), the latest news and announcements, as well as tips and tricks. Naturally, I was honored (and a bit scared) when they asked me to join them on the show to talk about the [Windows Azure AppFabric Service Bus](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/appfabric/default.aspx).

 

Let me state this for the record – I was right to be afraid! <grin>

 

Let’s talk about how I was introduced – [Wegner Clawed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwmLyEA52I4). Watch it for yourself. If you aren’t laughing hysterically then there’s something wrong with you. And for the record I am not related to Joe Wegner (at least I hope not)!

Next, [Wade’s Funky Fresh Beat](http://wadesfunkyfreshbeat.cloudapp.net/) – a tribute to both [Wegner Clawed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwmLyEA52I4) and the funky beat in my post [Using Social Web Providers in Less than 5 Minutes](http://www.wadewegner.com/2010/08/use-social-web-providers-in-less-than-5-minutes/). I’m moved that Steve took the time to put this together.

 

Of course, we did manage to spend some time talking about the Service Bus, and even showed a few demos (with a funky beat, I might add).


 

All-in-all, I had a ton of fun (despite losing a bit of dignity). Can’t wait to come on again!
