The important take away is that in this HOL you will take an application through the full provisioning process. This is extremely valuable if you have customers/partners looking to publish their applications into the Windows Azure Marketplace for Applications.

There are five exercises in the HOL:

 

  
  * **Exercise 0**: Understanding a SaaS Subscription Scenario
