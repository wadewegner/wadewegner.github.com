Not only is this my first time at [TechEd EMEA](http://europe.msteched.com/default.aspx), but it’s also my first time to Berlin. While exhausting, it’s been a ton of fun! I haven’t had a much time to explore the city yet, but I’ve spent a lot of time talking to customers about the [Windows Azure Platform](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/).

 

Today I am delivering the presentation [A Lap Around the Windows Azure AppFabric](http://europe.msteched.com/topic/List?keyword=asi205).

 

 

**[A Lap Around the Windows Azure AppFabric](http://www.slideshare.net/wwegner/a-lap-around-the-windows-azure-appfabric)**

 

 

Here’s the description:

 

>   
> 
> Come learn how to use services in the Windows Azure AppFabric (such as Service Bus, Access Control, and Caching) as building blocks for Web-based and Web-hosted applications, and how developers can leverage these services to create and extend applications in the cloud while also connecting them with on-premises systems. 

 

I’ll post links to the video and code downloads when they become available.

 

Enjoy!
