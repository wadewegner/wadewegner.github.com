George Huey has done it again! He has just published some significant updates to the [SQL Azure Migration Wizard](http://sqlazuremw.codeplex.com/).

 

Previously, I’ve described the SQL Azure Migration Wizard as a tool that helps you [migrate your SQL Server database into SQL Azure](http://www.wadewegner.com/index.php/2009/10/15/the-sql-azure-migration-wizard-will-now-migrate-your-data/). This is still true, but now, thanks to updates made by George Huey, you can also **migrate from SQL Azure-to-SQL Server and SQL Azure-to-SQL Azure**. These are significant updates to the tool!

 

Please watch the following video for an updated explanation of the tool:

                                                            

            ![](SQL Azure MW - Overview_Thumb.jpg)             ![](Preview.png)                                                         

            

                                   ![Get Microsoft Silverlight](http://go2.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=108181)              
                               [                 ![Get Microsoft Silverlight]()             ](http://go2.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=124807)                         

               

    
As I said, the updates made by George enable all the following scenarios for database migration …

 

  
  * SQL Server-to-SQL Azure 
   
  * SQL Azure-to-SQL Server 
   
  * SQL Azure-to-SQL Azure 
 

These last two updates are significant! Take a look at this [thread on the SQL Azure Migration Wizard codeplex site](http://sqlazuremw.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=77856) – the user had a scenario where they wanted to migrate a 1 GB database in SQL Azure into a 10 GB database in SQL Azure.

 

Please take a look at the [SQL Azure Migration Wizard up on Codeplex](http://sqlazuremw.codeplex.com/), where you can download the source code and/or binaries.
