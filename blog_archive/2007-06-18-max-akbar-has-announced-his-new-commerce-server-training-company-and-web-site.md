Max Akbar, Commerce Server expert and former Senior Product Manager for the Commerce Server team, has [announced his new training company and web site](http://blogs.msdn.com/maxakbar/archive/2007/06/18/commerce-server-training-part-iv.aspx). Training resources include video tutorials, DVDs, PowerPoint presentations, codes samples, and on-site training. You can find more information on his Web site at [http://www.commerceservertraining.com/](http://www.commerceservertraining.com/).

Max recently left Microsoft to consult and train companies using Commerce Server. While this is a huge loss for Microsoft, it is a huge win for the Commerce Server community as there has been a noticeable lack of training resources available. Max is sure to do an excellent job filling this void. Additionally, Max is acting as the [technical editor](http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,3c1236af-3d8f-4e64-bb30-231e7869930f.aspx) on my forthcoming book [_Professional Commerce Server 2007_](http://www.wadewegner.com/PermaLink,guid,96042b54-9859-4ea8-8497-5dab8033f405.aspx).

Best of luck, Max!
