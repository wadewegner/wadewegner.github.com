title: Joining Salesforce
---

Earlier this year I started an incubation project at [Aditi Technologies](http://www.aditi.com) to explore Salesforce as a platform for building cloud applications. Today I start at Salesforce as a full-time employee.

Life is funny sometimes, no?

When I [left Microsoft](http://www.wadewegner.com/2012/03/leaving-microsoft/) I did so to take a shot at [building products and applications](http://www.wadewegner.com/2012/04/joining-aditi-technologies-as-chief-technology-officer/) for Windows Azure. I've done that, and more. I hadnâ€™t planned on leaving Aditi any time soon but there are some opportunities too awesome to ignore. Such is the opportunity with Salesforce.

I'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished over the last two years and there's a lot that I'm going to miss. In particular, I will miss working with our product engineering team, led by [Ryan Dunn](http://dunnry.com/blog/) ([@dunnry](http://twitter.com/dunnry)). It's been an honor and privilege to work with him and the following engineers on the team: [Raghuraman Rajagopalan](http://in.linkedin.com/in/raghurajagopalan), [Vijaya Kumar Reddy Gajjala](http://in.linkedin.com/pub/vijaya-kumar-reddy-gajjala/11/974/647), [Sagar Matto](https://www.facebook.com/sagar.mattoo.77), [Brihadish Koushik](http://blog.aditi.com/author/brihadish-koushik/), and [John Belcher](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-belcher/76/479/2b6). 

There are too many other people I will miss to mention them all by name. Thank you all!

I'll have my work cut out for me at Salesforce. This is an incredibly exciting time and I've been impressed with the capabilities of the Force.com platform. This is also the most significant departure from the Microsoft platform I've made in my career, something both exciting and frightening! I am, and will remain, a strong proponent of the Windows Azure platform. What excites me is that I've found the Salesforce and Force.com platform equally as compelling, and I'm looking forward to my part in its advocacy. I have no doubt that it's going to be an amazing ride!

I'll have a lot more to say about my role at Salesforce in the coming weeks. For now I need to hunker down and prepare for [Dreamforce](http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF13/) - hope to see you there!
