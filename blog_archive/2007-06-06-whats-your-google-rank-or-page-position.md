I often find myself curious as to what my rank/position on Google is, given a set of keywords. For example, I know that if I search on my name ["Wade Wegner"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Wade+Wegner) this blog comes up second (my personal site being first). However, I sometimes wonder where my blog falls for other keywords, such as "commerce server 2007" or "biztalk server 2006".

So, I wrote this little tool to tell me!

This tool allows you to specify your URL (e.g. "[http://www.wadewegner.com/](http://www.wadewegner.com)") and some keywords (e.g. "commerce server 2007") and tells you what number you are. Currently, I have it scan only the first 1000 Google entries.

Useful, yes?

I realize it's a simple interface, but I just quickly slapped it together.

Any one know if this violates any of Googles terms of use? I hope not!

Enjoy!
