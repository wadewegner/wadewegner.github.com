Thanks to a link from [Joachim Lykke Andersen's DevTalk](http://devtalk.dk/) blog, I learned about a new blogging tool from Microsoft called "Windows Live Writer" (beta). Check out the details from the [Windows Live Writer team blog](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/).

This seems to be a great tool, and one I believe I'll use religiously. Check it out!
