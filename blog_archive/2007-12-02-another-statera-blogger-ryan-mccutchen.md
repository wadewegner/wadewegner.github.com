I just recently discovered that [Ryan McCutchen](http://www.ryan.mccutchenoutpost.com/), a colleague of mine here at [Statera](http://www.statera.com/), started blogging last month. In this past month he has already put together a number of excellent posts [discussing MOSS from an information worker, architect, and end-user perspective](http://www.ryan.mccutchenoutpost.com/).




Two posts that jumped out at me:






  * [Starting the WSS Search Service](http://www.ryan.mccutchenoutpost.com/PermaLink,guid,1994bd3b-f350-4088-9ba4-b63a8a7b6f8d.aspx) - I encountered this problem myself, recently. Too bad I hadn't read this post first.

  * [Architecture of MOSS Web Application Separation](http://www.ryan.mccutchenoutpost.com/PermaLink,guid,769f7596-e405-43cc-8dab-18b56f5de8ac.aspx) - Ryan discusses the separation of web applications in MOSS (e.g. separating out team sites).



This is definitely another blog to add to the blogroll!
