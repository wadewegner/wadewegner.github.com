title: PowerShell Script for Cleaning Up Your Windows Azure Resources
---

> Special thanks to [Michael Washam](michaelwasham.com/â€Ž) for helping me find and fix a bug in my code!

I find myself regularly creating resources in Windows Azure, such as cloud services, virtual machines, storage accounts, virtual networks, and the like. Most of the time this is part of writing scripts or testing out deployments, and I don't plan to keep them around indefinitely. The challenge this creates is how to cleanup all these resources. While it's possible to do this through the Windows Azure management portal you'll find in practice that it's slow and cumbersome.

Consequently, I've created a script which I use regularly to cleanup my resources.

There are times when I want to keep a particular cloud service or storage account around yet they belong to the same subscription as a lot of resources I want to delete. Fortunately it's easy to create an array of resource names and use the **-notin** operator in the script.

Before we start, a few quick tips:

1. Use the **Windows PowerShell ISE**. You'll find this makes life a lot easier.

2. Run the **Windows PowerShell ISE** as an administrator. I find it easiest to go to the **Advanced Properties** of the ISE and check the **Run as administrator** box.

3. Change the execution policy for PowerShell so that you can run your script in the ISE.

		Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

4. Download the correct publish settings file from the Windows Azure management portal. The easiest way to do this is to run the following command in the ISE:

		Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile

Okay, now that this is out of the way, here's the script I use for removing unwanted resources while preserving those I want to keep.

	Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile "C:\temp\me.publishsettings"
	
	$sub = "Windows Azure MVP"
	
	Select-AzureSubscription -SubscriptionName $sub  
	Set-AzureSubscription -DefaultSubscription $sub
	
	$websitesToSave = "website1", "website2"
	$VMsToSave = "vm1", "vm2"
	$storageAccountsToSave = "storageaccount1"
	
	cls
	
	Get-AzureWebsite | Where {$_.Name -notin $websitesToSave} | Remove-AzureWebsite -Force
	Get-AzureService | Where {$_.Label -notin $VMsToSave} | Remove-AzureService -Force
	Get-AzureDisk | Where {$_.AttachedTo -eq $null} | Remove-AzureDisk -DeleteVHD
	Get-AzureStorageAccount | Where {$_.Label -notin $storageAccountsToSave} | Remove-AzureStorageAccount
	Get-AzureAffinityGroup | Remove-AzureAffinityGroup
	Remove-AzureVNetConfig
 

Notice that the first thing I do is ensure I've selected the correct subscription. Next I define the resources I do not want to remove.

When executed you'll see output similar to the following:

	WARNING: 12:17:44 PM - Removing cloud service vm3...

**Note:** there's no way to specify a particular Virtual Network name.
Consequently, the best you can do is delete everything and, if the VNet is still in use it will throw an error. That's fine.

I hope it goes without saying that with **phenomenal cosmic power** comes great responsibility. You can _easily_ wreak havoc in your environments by deleting things you shouldn't. In fact, I would recommend you never run a script like this in a production environment; instead, focus on DEV/TEST environments.

Over time I'll like add additional resources to this list. For now I'm happy with the above as it removes most of the resources that have a monthly cost associated with them.

I hope this helps!
