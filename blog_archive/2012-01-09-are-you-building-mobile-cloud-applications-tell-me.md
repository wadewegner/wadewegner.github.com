If you follow my blog or [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/wadewegner) then you know that I’m passionate about using services running in Windows Azure to power mobile applications. To effectively run mobile services for mobile apps you need a platform that is responsive to a global audience and able to scale to the needs of your user base – Windows Azure provides these capabilities.

As part of the refresh of the [WindowsAzure.com](http://www.windowsazure.com/) we have also provided additional information about [mobile scenarios](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/mobile/) – it’s worth taking a look.

We’ve built a lot of resources that you should take a look at, including: the [Windows Azure Toolkit for iOS](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=234566&clcid=0x409), the [Windows Azure Toolkit for Android](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=234567&clcid=0x409), the [Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=214684&clcid=0x409), and a host of NuGet packages for Windows Phone and Windows Azure. All of these resources include native libraries (e.g. Objective-C for iOS and .NET for Windows Phone), sample applications, documentation, and tools. We also have a lot of videos and guides available to make the process of getting started as easy as possible.

**_How can you help?_**

One of my primary goals in 2012 is to continue to find and build compelling mobile applications that benefit from Windows Azure. We already have few great stories (see [T-Mobile USA](http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Windows-Azure/T-Mobile-USA/Mobile-Operator-Speeds-Time-to-Market-for-Innovative-Social-Networking-Solution/4000008598), [Red Badger](http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Windows-Azure/Red-Badger/Creative-Software-Consultancy-Uses-Cloud-Operating-System-for-Twitter-Push-Alerts/4000011213), [easyJet](http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Microsoft-Visual-Studio-Team-Foundation-Server-2010/easyJet/Airline-Aims-to-Save-Millions-Shorten-Airport-Waits-with-Cloud-Based-Mobile-Services/4000010767), and more) but that’s only scratching the surface – we can do a lot more!

So, I have a few questions of you:

* Are you building mobile applications that use services in Windows Azure? 

* Are you looking for additional PR and opportunities to highlight your applications? 

* Have you tried any of the toolkits or NuGet packages? 

* Do you have feedback for me regarding the use of the toolkits or NuGet packages? 

* What should we do that we aren’t today? 

* Do you have an application released to a marketplace – either Windows Phone, Apple, or Android – that uses Windows Azure? 

If you have any feedback to these questions then please contact me at [wade.wegner@microsoft.com](mailto:wade.wegner@microsoft.com). I want to hear from you!

Let’s see what we can accomplish together!
