As a native Illinoisan, I know that the [Taste of Chicago](http://www.explorechicago.org/city/en/things_see_do/event_landing/special_events/mose/taste_of_chicago.html) is a big deal! It is the largest outdoor food and music festival in the world, and is attended by more than 3 million people each year. If you like food and music, this is a festival for you!

This past year, the City of Chicago needed to quickly build out an interactive map for the event – and when I say quickly, I mean it. They needed an interactive mapping experience built and deployed in less than 10 days. To help make this a reality, the City of Chicago turned to a very capable Microsoft partner, [West Monroe Partners (WMP)](http://www.westmonroepartners.com/), for assistance.

 

The challenges here were pretty clear:

 

  
  * Build an interactive and immersive website in less than 10 days.
   
  * The website needed to scale massively for the event, but once the event was over they wanted to scale the infrastructure down.
   
  * WMP wanted to leverage their existing skills and tools.
 

WMP proposed the following – an immersive [Silverlight](http://silverlight.net/) Deep Zoom experience running on [Windows Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/) (if you’re not familiar with Deep Zoom, take a look at the [Hard Rock memorabilia site](http://memorabilia.hardrock.com/)). You can still visit the [Taste of Chicago interactive map](http://tasteofchicago09.cloudapp.net/) – check it out:

The [Windows Azure Platform](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/) – which I’ve discussed many times on my blog – is Microsoft’s cloud platform. It is comprised of the following: Windows Azure, an operating system as a service; SQL Azure, a fully relational database in the cloud; and .NET Services, consumable web-based services that provide both secure connectivity and federated access control for applications.

 

The City of Chicago’s decision to go with Silverlight and Windows Azure provided a host of very tangible benefits, including:

 

  
  * Fast, cost-effective development
   
  * Immediate customer satisfaction
   
  * Increased agility
   
  * Dynamic user experience
 

In fact, this is broken down in detail in the [Taste of Chicago case study with WMP and the City of Chicago](http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Case_Study_Detail.aspx?casestudyid=4000004836).

 

Additionally, Erik Brown – technical lead at WMP – spoke to Microsoft about their [experience building the interactive map in Silverlight and on Windows Azure](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Abe+Pachikara/SI-WMT-Handles-Client-Need-in-10-Days-Using-Azure/Default.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0). I definitely recommend you take a look:

A really great story about how a capable partner can leverage innovative technology to not only dazzle a customer, but provide a valuable service for millions of users.

 

I hope this helps!
