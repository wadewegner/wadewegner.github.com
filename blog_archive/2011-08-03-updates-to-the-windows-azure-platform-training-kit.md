Today we released the [Windows Azure Platform Training Kit – August 2011](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=130354). The Windows Azure Platform Training Kit (WAPTK) includes a comprehensive set of technical content including hands-on labs, presentations, and demos that are designed to help you learn how to use the Windows Azure platform.

In addition to the offline training kit above, we have pushed updates to the [Windows Azure Platform Training Course](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/gg271268) on MSDN.

 

**_What’s new in this release?_**

 

Today announced the [August 2011 release of the Windows Azure Tools for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2011/08/02/announcing-the-august-2011-release-of-the-windows-azure-tools-for-microsoft-visual-studio-2010.aspx) (i.e. VS Tools for Windows Azure 1.4). New to these tools are the following capabilities:

 

  
  * Profile applications running in Windows Azure 
   
  * Create ASP.NET MVC3 Web Roles 
   
  * Management Multiple service configurations in a single cloud project 
   
  * Improved validation of Windows Azure packages 
 

For more information on the updates to the tools, see these excellent posts by Technical Evangelists [Nick Harris](http://www.nickharris.net/2011/08/using-the-new-windows-azure-tools-v1-4-for-vs2010) and [Nathan Totten](http://ntotten.com/2011/08/windows-azure-tools-1-4-released).

 

We spent a significant amount of time reviewing and updating the training kit to make sure that the content works great with the 1.4 tools release. Additionally, we performed updates to hands-on labs and demos.

  * Labs and Demos             
    * All the labs and demos have been updated to leverage the [new Window Azure Tools 1.4](http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/install.aspx?appid=WindowsAzureToolsVS2010). 
       
    * Updated SSMS dependency of affected labs to SSMS SP1. 
       
   
  * Windows Azure Deployment             
    * Applied fix in the setup experience for the [Windows Azure Platform Management Cmdlets](http://wappowershell.codeplex.com/). 
       
    * Updated the [Windows Azure Platform Management Cmdlets](http://wappowershell.codeplex.com/) to the latest version. 
       
   
  * Building ASP.NET Applications with Windows Azure             
    * Changed the way the membership password was encrypted to fix minor bug when deployed to azure.
