Update (5/31/09) - as Glen notes in the below comment, you can order the book through an English language site.  Please seen the instructions in on his blog ([http://www.software-smith.com/csbook.html](http://www.software-smith.com/csbook.html)) or go directly [here for the site](http://www.stauffacher.ch/en/ste_start_startseite/mailartikel/ID17591813.html?jumpId=4309055) (still a little German, but it's easier to follow in English).

![Commerce Server 2007](https://wadewegner.blob.core.windows.net/wordpress/2009/05/image.png)

The first – and only – book on [Commerce Server 2007](http://www.amazon.de/Software-Smiths-Commerce-Server-2007-Smith/dp/3837038564/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1242725175&sr=8-3) is now available! (Here’s the translated version, thanks to Microsoft Translator - [http://bit.ly/Gfm7R](http://bit.ly/Gfm7R); note that you cannot purchase the book when using translator.)

Unfortunately, the only location you can currently purchase the book is from Amazon.de – not sure why it’s not available at Amazon.com, but hopefully this gets resolved soon.  I can assure you that this is an English version, and not German.

That aside, I really hope you find this a useful book.  It’s been a longtime coming, but it’s here now!  Go [buy it](http://www.amazon.de/Software-Smiths-Commerce-Server-2007-Smith/dp/3837038564/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1242725175&sr=8-3)!  If you have any issues purchasing this book, please let me know ASAP.
